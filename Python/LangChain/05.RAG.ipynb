A CLERK IN ORDERS  \\n  \\nThe white walls of the Château of Deux-manoirs, with its precincts, composed, before its dismantling at \\nthe Revolution, the one prominent object which towards the southwest broke the pleasant level of La \\nBeauce, the great corn-land of central France.  Abode in those days of the family of Latour, nesting there \\ncentury after century, it recorded significantly the effectiveness of their brotherly union, less by way of \\ninvasion of the rights of others than by the improvement of all gentler sentiments within.  From the \\nsumptuous monuments of their last resting-place, backwards to every object which had encircled them in \\nthat warmer and more lightsome home it was visible they had cared for so much, even in some \\npeculiarities of the very ground-plan of the house itself--everywhere was the token of their anxious \\nestimate of all those incidents of man's pathway through the world which knit the wayfarers thereon most \\nclosely together.  \\nWhy this irregularity of ground-plan?--the traveller would ask; recognising indeed a certain distinction in its\\nactual effect on the eye, and suspecting perhaps some conscious aim at such effect on the part of the \\nbuilders of the place in an age indulgent of architectural caprices.  And the traditional answer to the \\nquestion, true for once, still showed the race of Latour making much, making the most, of the sympathetic \\nties of human life.  The work, in large measure, of Gaston de Latour, it was left unfinished at his death, \\nsome time about the year 1594.  That it was never completed could hardly be attributed to any lack of \\nmeans, or of interest; for it is plain that to the period of the Revolution, after which its scanty remnants \\npassed into humble occupation (a few circular turrets, a crenellated curtain wall, giving a random touch of \\ndignity to some ordinary farm-buildings) the place had been scrupulously maintained. It might seem to \\nhave been a kind of reverence rather that had allowed the work to remain untouched for future ages \\nprecisely at this point in its growth.  \\nAnd the expert architectural mind, peeping acutely into recondite motives and half-accomplished \\npurposes in such matters, could detect the circumstance which had determined that so noticeable \\npeculiarity of ground-plan.  Its kernel was not, as in most similar buildings of that date, a feudal fortress, \\nbut an unfortified manor-house--a double manoir--two houses, oddly associated at a right angle.  Far back\\nin the Middle Age, said a not uncertain tradition, here had been the one point of contact between two \\nestates, intricately interlocked with alien domain, as, in the course of generations, the family of Latour, \\nand another, had added field to field.  In the single lonely manor then existing two brothers had grown up; \\nand the time came when the marriage of the younger to the heiress of those neighbouring lands would \\ndivide two perfect friends.  Regretting over-night so dislocating a change it was the elder who, as the \\ndrowsy hours flowed away in manifold recollection beside the fire, now suggested to the younger, himself \\nalready wistfully recalling, as from the past, the kindly motion and noise of the place like a sort of audible \\nsunlight, the building of a second manor-house--the Château d'Amour, as it came to be called--that the \\ntwo families, in what should be as nearly as possible one abode, might take their fortunes together.  \\nOf somewhat finer construction than the rough walls of the older manor, the Château d'Amour stood, amid\\nthe change of years, as a visible record of all the accumulated sense of human existence among its \\noccupants.  The old walls, the old apartments, of those two associated houses still existed, with some \\nobvious additions, beneath the delicate, fantastic surfaces of the château of the sixteenth century.  Its \\nsingularity of outline was the very symbol of the religion of the family in the race of Latour, still full of \\nloyalty to the old home, as its numerous outgrowths took hold here and there around.  A race with some \\nprominent characteristics ineradicable in the grain, they went to raise the human level about them by a \", metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n Document(page_content='transfer of blood, far from involving any social decadence in themselves.  A peculiar local variety of \\ncharacter, of manners, in that district of La Beauce, surprised the more observant visitor who might find \\nhis way into farmhouse or humble presbytery of its scattered townships.  And as for those who kept up the\\ncentral tradition of their house, they were true to the soil, coming back, under whatever obstacles, from \\ncourt, from cloister, from distant crusade, to the visible spot where the memory of their kindred was \\nliveliest and most exact--a memory, touched so solemnly with a conscience of the intimacies of life, its \\nsignificant events, its contacts and partings, that to themselves it was like a second sacred history.  \\nIt was a great day, amid all their quiet days, for the people of Deux-manoirs--one of the later days of \\nAugust.  The event, which would mark it always in the life of one of them, called into play all that was most\\nexpressive in that well-defined family character: it was at once the recognition of what they valued most in\\npast years, and an assertion of will, or hope, for the future, accordant thereto.  Far away in Paris the \\nyoung King Charles the Ninth, in his fourteenth year, had been just declared of age.  Here, in the church \\nof Saint Hubert, church of their parish, and of their immemorial patronage, though it lay at a considerable \\ndistance from their abode, the chiefs of the house of Latour, attended by many of its dependents and less \\nimportant members, were standing ready, around the last hope of their old age--the grandparents, their \\naged brothers and sisters, certain aged ecclesiastics of their kindred, wont to be called to the family \\ncouncils.  \\nThey had set out on foot, after a votive mass said early in the old chapel of the manor, to assist at the \\nceremony of the day. Distinguishable from afar by unusual height in proportion to its breadth within, the \\nchurch of Saint Hubert had an atmosphere, a daylight, to itself.  Its stained glass, work of the same hands \\nthat had wrought for the cathedral of Chartres, admitted only an almost angry ray of purple or crimson, \\nhere or there, across the dark, roomy spaces.  The heart, the heart of youth at least, sank, as one \\nentered, stepping warily out of the sunshine over the sepulchral stones which formed the entire pavement \\nof the church, a great blazonry of family history from age to age for indefatigable eyes. An abundance of \\nalmost life-sized sculpture clung to the pillars, lurked in the angles, seemed, with those symbolical \\ngestures, and mystic faces ready to speak their parts, to be almost in motion through the gloom.  Many \\nyears after, Gaston de Latour, an enemy of all Gothic darkness or heaviness, returning to his home full of \\na later taste, changed all that.  A thicket of airy spires rose above the sanctuary; the blind triforium broke \\ninto one continuous window; the heavy masses of stone were pared down with wonderful dexterity of \\nhand, till not a hand\\'s-breadth remained uncovered by delicate tracery, as from the fair white roof, \\ntouched sparingly with gold, down to the subterranean chapel of Saint Taurin, where the peasants of La \\nBeauce came to pray for rain, not a space was left unsearched by cheerful daylight, refined, but hardly \\ndimmed at all, by painted glass mimicking the clearness of the open sky.  In the sombre old church all \\nwas in stately order now: the dusky, jewelled reliquaries, the ancient devotional ornaments from the \\nmanor--much-prized family possessions, sufficient to furnish the whole array of a great ecclesiastical \\nfunction like this--the lights burning, flowers everywhere, gathered amid the last handfuls of the harvest by\\nthe peasant-women, who came to present their children for the happy chance of an episcopal blessing.  \\nAnd the almost exclusively aged people, in all their old personal adornments, which now so rarely saw the\\nlight, forming the central group, expectant around the young seigneur they had conducted hither, seemed \\nof one piece with those mystic figures, the old, armour- clad monumental effigies, the carved and painted \\nimageries which ran round the outer circuit of the choir--a version of the biblical history, for the reading of \\nthose who loitered on their way from chapel to chapel.  There was Joseph\\'s dream, with the tall sheaves \\nof the elder brethren bowing to Joseph\\'s sheaf, like these aged heads around the youthful aspirant of \\nto-day.  There was Jacob going on his mysterious way, met by, conversing with, wrestling with, the \\nAngels of God--rescuing the promise of his race from the \"profane\" Esau. There was the mother of \\nSamuel, and, in long white ephod, the much- desired, early-consecrated child, who had inherited her \\nreligious capacity; and David, with something of his extraordinary genius for divine things written on his \\ncountenance; onward, to the sacred persons of the Annunciation, with the golden lily in the silver cup, \\nonly lately set in its place.  With dress, expression, nay! the very incidents themselves innocently adapted \\nto the actual habits and associations of the age which had produced them, these figures of the old Jewish \\nhistory seemed about to take their places, for the imparting of a divine sanction, among the living actors of\\nthe day. One and all spoke of ready concurrence with religious motions, a ready apprehension of, and \\nconcurrence with, the provisions of a certain divine scheme for the improvement of one\\'s opportunities in \\nthe world.  \\nWould that dark-haired, fair-skinned lad concur, in his turn, and be always true to his present ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n Document(page_content='purpose--Gaston de Latour, standing thus, almost the only youthful thing, amid the witness of these \\nimposing, meditative, masks and faces?  Could his guardians have read below the white propriety of the \\nyouth, duly arrayed for dedication, with the lighted candle in his right hand and the surplice folded over his\\nleft shoulder, he might sorely have disturbed their placid but somewhat narrow ruminations, with the \\ngerms of what was strange to or beyond them.  Certain of those shrewd old ecclesiastics had in fact \\ndetected that the devout lad, so visibly impressed, was not altogether after their kind; that, together with \\nmany characteristics obviously inherited, he possessed--had caught perhaps from some ancestor \\nunrepresented here--some other potencies of nature, which might not always combine so accordantly as \\nto-day with the mental requisites of an occasion such as this.  One of them, indeed, touched \\nnotwithstanding by his manifest piety just then, shortly afterwards recommended him a little prayer \"for \\npeace\" from the Vespers of the Roman Breviary--for the harmony of his heart with itself; advice which, \\nexcept for a very short period, he ever afterwards followed, saying it every evening of his life.  \\nYet it was the lad\\'s own election which had led him to this first step in a career that might take him out of \\nthe world and end the race of Latour altogether.  Approaching their fourscore years, and realising almost \\nsuddenly the situation of the young Gaston, left there alone, out of what had been a large, \\nmuch-promising, resonant household, they wished otherwise, but did not try to change his \\nearly-pronounced preference for the ecclesiastical calling.  When he determined to seek the clericature, \\nhis proposal made a demand on all their old-fashioned religious sentiment.  But the fund was a deep one, \\nand their acquiescence in the result entire.  He might indeed use his privilege of \"orders\" only as the \\nstepping-stone to material advancement in a church which seemed to have gone over wholly to the world,\\nand of which at that time one half the benefices were practically in the hands of laymen.  But, actually, the\\nevent came to be a dedication on their part, not unlike those old biblical ones--an offering in old age of the\\nsingle precious thing left them; the grandchild, whose hair would presently fall under the very shears \\nwhich, a hundred years before, had turned an earlier, brilliant, Gaston de Latour into a monk.  \\nCharles Guillard, Bishop of Chartres, a courtly, vivacious prelate, whose quick eyes seemed to note at a \\nglance the whole assembly, one and all, while his lips moved silently, arrived at last, and the rite began \\nwith the singing of the Office for the Ninth Hour.  It was like a stream of water crossing unexpectedly a \\ndusty way--Mirabilia testimonia tua!  In psalm and antiphon, inexhaustibly fresh, the soul seemed to be \\ntaking refuge, at that undevout hour, from the sordid languor and the mean business of men\\'s lives, in \\ncontemplation of the unfaltering vigour of the divine righteousness, which had still those who sought it, not\\nonly watchful in the night but alert in the drowsy afternoon.  Yes! there was the sheep astray, sicut ovis \\nquae periit--the physical world; with its lusty ministers, at work, or sleeping for a while amid the stubble, \\ntheir faces upturned to the August sun--the world so importunately visible, intruding a little way, with its \\nfloating odours, in that semicircle of heat across the old over-written pavement at the great open door, \\nupon the mysteries within.  Seen from the incense-laden sanctuary, where the bishop was assuming one \\nby one the pontifical ornaments, La Beauce, like a many- coloured carpet spread under the great dome, \\nwith the white double house-front quivering afar through the heat, though it looked as if you might touch \\nwith the hand its distant spaces, was for a moment the unreal thing.  Gaston alone, with all his mystic \\npreoccupations, by the privilege of youth, seemed to belong to both, and link the visionary company about\\nhim to the external scene.  \\nThe rite with which the Roman Church \"makes a clerk,\" aims certainly at no low measure of difference \\nfrom the coarser world around him, in its supposed scholar: and in this case the aspirant (the precise \\nclaims of the situation being well considered) had no misgiving. Discreetly, and with full attention, he \\nanswers Adsum! when his name is called, and advances manfully; though he kneels meekly enough, and \\nremains, with his head bowed forward, at the knees of the seated bishop who recites the appointed \\nprayers, between the anthems and responses of his Schola, or attendant singers--Might he be saved from\\nmental blindness!  Might he put on the new man, even as his outward guise was changed!  Might he keep\\nthe religious habit for ever! who had thus hastened to lay down the hair of his head for the divine love.  \\n\"The Lord is my inheritance\" whispers Gaston distinctly, as the locks fall, cut from the thickly-grown, black \\nhead, in five places, \"after the fashion of Christ\\'s crown,\" the shears in the episcopal hands sounding \\naloud, amid the silence of the curious spectators.  From the same hands, in due order, the fair surplice \\nripples down over him.  \"This is the generation of them that seek Him,\" the choir sings: \"The Lord Himself \\nis the portion of my inheritance and my cup.\"  It was the Church\\'s eloquent way of bidding unrestricted \\nexpansion to the youthful heart in its timely purpose to seek the best, to abide among the things of the \\nspirit.  ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n Document(page_content='The prospect from their cheerful, unenclosed road, like a white scarf flung across the land, as the party \\nreturned home in the late August afternoon, was clear and dry and distant.  The great barns at the \\nwayside had their doors thrown back, displaying the dark, cool space within.  The farmsteads seemed \\nalmost tenantless, the villagers being still at work over the immense harvest-field.  Crazy bells startled \\nthem, striking out the hour from behind, over a deserted churchyard.  Still and tenantless also seemed the\\nmanor as they approached, door and window lying open upon the court for the coolness; or rather it was \\nas if at their approach certain spectral occupants started back out of the daylight--\"Why depart, dear \\nghosts?\" was what the grandparents would have cried.  They had more in common with that immaterial \\nworld than with flesh and blood. There was room for the existing household, enough and to spare, in one \\nof the two old houses.  That other, the Château d\\'Amour, remained for Gaston, at first as a delightful, \\nhalf-known abode of wonders, though with some childish fear; afterwards, as a delightful nursery of \\nrefined or fantastic sentiment, as he recalled, in this chamber or that, its old tenants and their doings, from\\nthe affectionate brothers, onwards--above all, how in one room long ago Gabrielle de Latour had died of \\njoy.  \\nWith minds full of their recent business it was difficult to go back to common occupations; as darkness \\ncame on, the impressions of the day did but return again more vividly and concentrate themselves upon \\nthe inward sense.  Observance, loyal concurrence in some high purpose for him, passive waiting on the \\nhand one might miss in the darkness, with the gift or gifts therein of which he had the presentiment, and \\nupon the due acceptance of which the true fortune of life would turn; these were the hereditary traits alert \\nin Gaston, as he lay awake in the absolute, moon-lit, stillness, his outward ear attentive for the wandering \\nfootsteps which, through that wide, lightly-accentuated country, often came and went about the house, \\nwith weird suggestions of a dim passage to and fro, and of an infinite distance.  He would rise, as the \\nfootsteps halted perhaps below his window, to answer the questions of the travellers, pilgrims, or \\nlabourers who had missed their way from farm to farm, or halting soldier seeking guidance; terrible or \\nterror-stricken companies sometimes, rudely or piteously importunate to be let in-- for it was the period of \\nthe Religious Wars, flaming up here and there over France, and never quite put out, during forty years.  \\nOnce, in the beginning of these troubles (he was then a child, leaning from the window, as a sound of \\nrickety, small wheels approached) the enquiry came in broken French, \"Voulez-vous donner direction?\" \\nfrom a German, one of the mercenaries of the Duc de Guise, hired for service in a civil strife of France, \\ndrawing wearily a crippled companion, so far from home. The memory of it, awakening a thousand \\nstrange fancies, had remained by him, as a witness to the power of fortuitous circumstance over the \\nimagination.  \\nOne night there had come a noise of horns, and presently King Charles himself was standing in the \\ncourtyard, belated, and far enough now from troublesome company, as he hunted the rich-fleshed game \\nof La Beauce through the endless corn.  He entered, with a relish for the pleasant cleanliness of the \\nplace, expressed in a shrill strain of half-religious oaths, like flashes of hell-fire to Gaston\\'s suddenly- \\nawakened sense.  It was the invincible nature of the royal lad to speak, and feel, on these mad, alto \\nnotes, and not unbecoming in a good catholic; for Huguenots never swore, and these were subtly \\ntheological oaths.  Well! the grandparents repressed as best they could their apprehensions as to what \\nother hunters, what other disconcerting incident, might follow; for catholic France very generally believed \\nthat the Huguenot leaders had a scheme for possessing themselves of the person of the young king, \\nknown to be mentally pliable.  Meanwhile they led him to their daintiest apartment, with great silver \\nflambeaux, that he might  wash off the blood with which not his hands only were covered; for he hunted \\nalso with the eagerness of a madman--steeped in blood.  He lay there for a few hours, after supping very \\nfamiliarly on his own birds, Gaston rising from his bed to look on at a distance, and, afterwards, on his \\nknee, serving the rose-water dish and spiced wine, as the night passed in reassuring silence; Charles \\nhimself, as usual, keenly enjoying this \"gipsy\" incident, with the supper after that unexpected fashion, \\namong strange people, he hardly knew where.  He was very pale, like some cunning Italian work in wax \\nor ivory, of partly satiric character, endued by magic or crafty mechanism with vivacious movement.  But \\nas he sat thus, ever for the most part the unhappy plaything of other people\\'s humours, escaped for a \\nmoment out of a world of demoniac politicians, the pensive atmosphere around seemed gradually to \\nchange him, touching his wild temper, pleasantly, profitably, so that he took down from the wall and struck\\nout the notes of a lute, and fell to talking of verses, leaving a stanza of his own scratched with a diamond \\non the window-pane--lines simpler- hearted, and more full of nature than were common at that day.  \\nThe life of Gaston de Latour was almost to coincide with the duration of the Religious Wars.  The earliest ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 3}),\n Document(page_content='public event of his memory was that famous siege of Orleans from which the young Henri de Guise rode \\naway the head of his restless family, tormented now still further by the reality or the pretence of filial duty, \\nseeking vengeance on the treacherous murder of his father.  Following a long period of quiet \\nprogress--the tranquil and tolerant years of the Renaissance-- the religious war took possession of, and \\npushed to strangely confused issues, a society somewhat distraught by an artificial aesthetic culture; and \\nfilled with wild passions, wildly-dramatic personalities, a scene already singularly attractive by its artistic \\nbeauty.  A heady religious fanaticism was worked by every prominent egotist in turn, pondering on his \\nchances, in the event of the extinction of the house of Valois with the three sons of Catherine de Medici, \\nborn unsound, and doomed by astrological prediction.  The old manors, which had exchanged their \\ntowers for summer-houses under the softening influence of Renaissance fashions, found themselves \\nonce more medievally insecure amid a vagrant warfare of foreign mercenaries and armed peasants.  It \\nwas a curiously refined people who now took down the armour, hanging high on the wall for decoration \\namong newer things so little warlike.  \\nA difficult age, certainly, for scrupulous spirits to move in!  A perplexed network of partizan or personal \\ninterests underlay, and furnished the really directing forces in, a supposed Armageddon of contending \\nreligious convictions.  The wisest perhaps, like Michel de L\\'Hôpital, withdrew themselves from a conflict, \\nin which not a single actor has the air of quite pure intentions; while religion, itself the assumed ground of \\nquarrel, seems appreciable all the while only by abstraction from the parties, the leaders, at once violent \\nand cunning, who are most pretentious in the assertion of its rival claims.  What there was of religion was \\nin hiding, perhaps, with the so-called \"Political\" party, professedly almost indifferent to it, but which had at \\nleast something of humanity on its side, and some chance of that placidity of mind in which alone the \\nbusiness of the spirit can be done.  The new sect of \"Papists\" were not the true catholics: there was little \\nof the virtue of the martyr in militant Calvinism.  It is not a catholic historian who notes with profound regret\\n\"that inauspicious day,\" in the year 1562, Gaston\\'s tenth year, \"when the work of devastation began, \\nwhich was to strip from France that antique garniture of religious art which later ages have not been able \\nto replace.\"  Axe and hammer at the carved work sounded from one end of France to the other.  \\nIt was a peculiarity of this age of terror, that every one, including Charles the Ninth himself, dreaded what \\nthe accident of war might make, not merely of his enemies, but of temporary allies and pretended friends, \\nin an evenly balanced but very complex strife--of merely personal rivals also, in some matter which had \\nnothing to do with the assumed motives of that strife.  Gaston de Latour passing on his country way one \\nnight, with a sudden flash of fierce words two young men burst from the doors of a road-side tavern.  The \\nbrothers are quarrelling about the division, lately effected there, of their dead father\\'s morsel of land.  \"I \\nshall hate you till death!\" cries the younger, bounding away in the darkness; and two atheists part, to take \\nopposite sides in the supposed strife of Catholic and Huguenot.  \\nThe deeds of violence which occupy the foreground of French history during the reigns of Catherine\\'s \\nsons might indeed lead one to fancy that little human kindness could have remained in France,--a \\nfanatical civil war of forty years, that no place at all could have been left for the quiet building of character.\\n Contempt for human life, taught us every day by nature, and alas! by man himself:--all war intensifies \\nthat.  But the more permanent forces, alike of human nature and of the natural world, are on the whole in \\nthe interest of tranquillity and sanity, and of the sentiments proper to man.  Like all good catholic children, \\nGaston had shuddered at the name of Adretz, of Briquemaut with his great necklace of priests\\' ears, of \\nthat dark and fugitive Montgomeri, the slayer, as some would have it the assassin, of a king, now active, \\nand almost ubiquitous, on the Huguenot side.  Still, at Deux-manoirs, this warfare, seething up from time \\nto time so wildly in this or that district of France, was for the most part only sensible in incidents we might \\nthink picturesque, were they told with that intention; delightful enough, certainly, to the curiosity of a boy, \\nin whose mind nevertheless they deepened a native impressibility to the sorrow and hazard that are \\nconstant and necessary in human life, especially for the poor. The troubles of \"that poor people of \\nFrance\"--burden of all its righteous rulers, from Saint Lewis downwards--these, at all events, would not be\\nlessened by the struggle of Guise and Condé and Bourbon and Valois, of the Valois with each other, of \\nthose four brilliant young princes of the name of Henry.  The weak would but suffer somewhat more than \\nwas usual, in the interest of the strong.  If you were not sure whether that gleaming of the sun in the vast \\ndistance flashed from swords or sickles, whether that far-off curl of smoke rose from stubble-fire or \\nvillage-steeple, to protect which the peasants, still lovers of their churches, would arm themselves, women\\nand all, with fork and scythe,--still, those peasants used their scythes, in due season, for reaping their \\nleagues of cornland, and slept with faces as tranquil as ever towards the sky, for their noonday rest.  In ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n Document(page_content=\"effect, since peace is always in some measure dependent on one's own seeking, disturbing forces do but \\nfray their way along somewhat narrow paths over the great spaces of the quiet realm of nature.  La \\nBeauce, vast enough to present at once every phase of weather, its one landmark the twin spires of \\nChartres, salient as the finger of a dial, guiding, by their change of perspective, victor or vanquished on \\nhis way, offered room enough for the business both of peace and war to those enamoured of either.  \\nWhen Gaston, after a brief absence, was unable to find his child's garden-bed, that was only because in a\\nfine June the corn had grown tall so quickly, through which he was presently led to it, with all its garish \\nsweets undisturbed: and it was with the ancient growths of mind--customs, beliefs, mental \\npreferences--as with the natural world.  \\nIt may be understood that there was a certain rudeness about the old manor, left almost untouched from \\nage to age, with a loyalty which paid little or no heed to changes of fashion.  The Château d'Amour, \\nindeed, as the work of a later age, refined somewhat upon the rough feudal architecture; and the daintier \\ntaste had centred itself in particular upon one apartment, a veritable woman's apartment, with an effect in \\nsome degree anticipating the achievement of Gaston's own century, in which the apparatus of daily life \\nbecame so eloquent of the moods of those to whom it ministered.  It was the chamber of Gabrielle de \\nLatour, who had died of joy.  Here certainly she had watched, at these windows, during ten whole years, \\nfor the return of her beloved husband from a disastrous battle in the East, till against all expectation she \\nbeheld him crossing the court at last. Immense privilege!  Immense distinction!  Again and again Gaston \\ntried to master the paradox, at times, in deep concentration of mind, seemed almost to touch the point of \\nthat wonderful moment.  \\nHither, as to an oratory, a religious place, the finer spirits of her kin had always found their way, to leave \\nbehind them there the more intimate relics of themselves.  To Gaston its influence imparted early a taste \\nfor delicate things as being indispensable in all his pleasures to come; and, from the very first, with the \\nappetite for some great distinguishing passion, the peculiar genius of his age seeming already awake \\nspontaneously within him.  Here, at least, had been one of those grand passions, such as were needed to\\ngive life its true meaning and effect.  Conscious of that rudeness in his home, and feeding a strong natural\\ninstinct for outward beauty hitherto on what was barely sufficient, he found for himself in this perfumed \\nplace the centre of a fanciful world, reaching out to who could tell what refined passages of existence in \\nthat great world beyond, of which the echoes seemed to light here amid the stillness.  On his first visit one\\npensive afternoon, fitting the lately attained key in the lock, he seemed to have drawn upon himself, yet \\nhardly to have disturbed, the meditations of its former occupant.  A century of unhindered summers had \\ntaken the heat from its colours--the couches, the curtains half shading the windows, which the rain in the \\nsouth- west wind just then touched so softly.  That great passion of old had been also a dainty love, \\nleaving its impress everywhere in this magic apartment, on the musical instruments, the books lying \\nwhere they might have fallen from the hands of the listless reader so long since, the fragrance which the \\nlad's movement stirred around him. And there, on one of the windows, were the verses of King Charles, \\nwho had slept here, as in the most courtly resting-place of the house.  On certain nights Gaston himself \\nwas not afraid to steal from his own bed to lie in it, though still too healthy a sleeper to be visited by the \\nappropriate dreams he so greatly longed for.  \\nA nature, instinctively religious, which would readily discover and give their full value to all such facts of \\nexperience as might be conformable thereto!  But what would be the relation of this religious sensibility to \\nsensibilities of another kind, now awaking in the young Gaston, as he mused in this dreamy place, \\nsurrounded by the books, the furniture, almost the very presence of the past, which had already found \\ntongues to speak of a still living humanity-- somewhere, somewhere, in the world!--waiting for him in the \\ndistance, or perchance already on its way, to explain, by its own plenary beauty and power, why wine and\\nroses and the languorous summer afternoons were so delightful.  So far indeed, the imaginative heat, that\\nmight one day enter into dangerous rivalry with simple old- fashioned faith, was blent harmoniously with it.\\n They were hardly distinguishable elements of an amiable character, susceptible generally to the poetic \\nside of things--two neighbourly apprehensions of a single ideal.  \\nThe great passions, the fervid sentiments, of which Gaston dreamed as the true realisation of life, have \\nnot always softened men's natures: they have been compatible with many cruelties, as in the lost spirits of\\nthat very age.  They may overflow, on the other hand, in more equable natures, through the concurrence \\nof happier circumstance, into that universal sympathy which lends a kind of amorous power to the \\nhomeliest charities.  So it seemed likely to be with Gaston de Latour.  Sorrow came along with beauty, a \\nrival of its intricate omnipresence in life.  In the sudden tremor of an aged voice, the handling of a \", metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n Document(page_content='forgotten toy, a childish drawing, in the tacit observance of a day, he became aware suddenly of the great \\nstream of human tears falling always through the shadows of the world.  For once the darling of old age \\nactually more than responded in full to its tenderness.  In the isolation of his life there had been little \\ndemand for sympathy on the part of those anywhere near his own age. So much the larger was the fund \\nof superfluous affection which went forth, with a delicacy not less than their own, to meet the sympathies \\nof the aged people who cherished him.  In him, their old, almost forgotten sorrows bled anew.  \\nVariety of affection, in a household in which many relations had lived together, had brought variety of \\nsorrow.  But they were well- nigh healed now--those once so poignant griefs--the scars remaining only as \\ndeeper lines of natural expression.  It was visible, to their surprise, that he penetrated the motive of the \\nmass said so solemnly, in violet, on the Innocents\\' Day, and understood why they wept at the triumphant \\nantiphons:--\"My soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowler!\"--thinking intently of the little \\ntombs which had recorded carefully almost the minutes of children\\'s lives, Elizabeth de Latour, Cornélius \\nde Latour, aged so many years, days, hours. Yes! the cold pavement under one\\'s feet had once been \\nmolten lava. Surely the resources of sorrow were large in things!  The fact must be duly marked and \\nprovided for, with due estimate of his own susceptibility thereto, in his scheme of life.  Might he pass \\nthrough the world, unriven by sorrows such as those!  And already it was as if he stept softly over the \\nearth, not to outrage its so abundant latent sensibilities.  \\nThe beauty of the world and its sorrow, solaced a little by religious faith, itself so beautiful a thing; these \\nwere the chief impressions with which he made his way outwards, at first only in longer rambles, as \\nphysical strength increased, over his native plains, whereon, as we have seen, the cruel warfare of that \\nage had aggravated at a thousand points the everyday appeal of suffering humanity.  The vast level, \\nstretching thirty miles from east to west, thirty from north to south:--perhaps the reader may think little of \\nits resources for the seeker after natural beauty, or its capacity to develope the imagination.  A world, he \\nmay fancy, in which there could be no shadows, at best not too cheerful colours.  In truth, it was all \\naccent, so to speak.  But then, surely, all the finer influences of every language depend mostly on accent; \\nand he has but to think of it as Gaston actually lived in it to find a singularly companionable soul there.  \\nGaston, at least, needed but to go far enough across it for those inward oppositions to cease, which \\nalready at times beset him; to feel at one with himself again, under the influence of a scene which had for \\nhim something of the character of the sea--its changefulness, its infinity, its pathos in the toiling human life\\nthat traversed it.  Featureless, if you will, it was always under the guidance of its ample sky.  Scowling \\nback sometimes moodily enough, but almost never without a remnant of fine weather, about August it was\\nfor the most part cloudless.  And then truly, under its blue dome, the great plain would as it were \"laugh \\nand sing,\" in a kind of absoluteness of sympathy with the sun.  \\n  \\nCHAPTER II.  OUR LADY\\'S CHURCH  \\n  \\n     \"I had almost said even as they.\"  \\nLike a ship for ever a-sail in the distance, thought the child, everywhere the great church of Chartres was \\nvisible, with the passing light or shadow upon its grey, weather-beaten surfaces.  The people of La \\nBeauce were proud, and would talk often of its rich store of sacred furniture, the wonder-working relics of \\n\"Our Lady under the Earth,\" and her sacred veil or shift, which kings and princes came to visit, returning \\nwith a likeness thereof, replete in miraculous virtue, for their own wearing.  The busy fancy of Gaston, \\nmultiplying this chance hearsay, had set the whole interior in array--a dim, spacious, fragrant place, afloat \\nwith golden lights.  Lit up over the autumn fields at evening, the distant spires suggested the splendour \\nwithin, with so strong an imaginative effect, that he seemed scarcely to know whether it was through the \\nmental or bodily eye that he beheld.  When he came thither at last, like many another well- born youth, to \\njoin the episcopal household as a kind of half- clerical page, he found (as happens in the actual testing of \\nour ideals) at once more and less than he had supposed; and his earlier vision was a thing he could never\\nprecisely recover, or disentangle from the supervening reality.  What he saw, certainly, was greater far in \\nmere physical proportion, and incommensurable at first by anything he knew--the volume of the wrought \\ndetail, the mass of the component members, the bigness of the actual stones of the masonry, contrary to \\nthe usual Gothic manner, and as if in reminiscence of those old Druidic piles amid which the Virgin of \\nChartres had been adored, long before the birth of Christ, by a mystic race, possessed of some prophetic \\nsense of the grace in store for her.  Through repeated dangers good-fortune has saved that unrivalled \\ntreasure of stained glass; and then, as now, the word \"awful,\" so often applied to Gothic aisles, was for ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n Document(page_content='once really applicable.  You enter, looking perhaps for a few minutes\\' cool shelter from the summer \\nnoonday; and the placid sunshine of La Beauce seems to have been transformed in a moment into \\nimperious, angry fire.  \\nIt was not in summer, however, that Gaston first set foot there; he saw the beautiful city for the first time \\nas if sheathed austerely in repellent armour.  In his most genial subsequent impressions of the place there\\nwas always a lingering trace of that famous frost through which he made his way, wary of petrifying \\ncontact against things without, to the great western portal, on Candlemas morning. The sad, patient \\nimages by the doorways of the crowded church seemed suffering now chiefly from the cold.  It was almost\\nlike a funeral-- the penitential violet, the wandering taper-light, of this half- lenten feast of Purification.  His \\nnew companions, at the head and in the rear of the long procession, forced every one, even the Lord \\nBishop himself, to move apace, bustling along, cross-bearer and acolyte, in their odd little copes, out of \\nthe bitter air, which made the jolly life Gaston now entered on, around the great fire of their hall in the \\nepiscopal palace, seem all the more winsome.  \\nNotre-Dame de Chartres!  It was a world to explore, as if one explored the entire Middle Age; it was also \\none unending, elaborate, religious function--a life, or a continuous drama, to take one\\'s part in.  \\nDependent on its structural completeness, on its wealth of well- preserved ornament, on its unity in \\nvariety, perhaps on some undefinable operation of genius, beyond, but concurrently with, all these, the \\nchurch of Chartres has still the gift of a unique power of impressing.  In comparison, the other famous \\nchurches of France, at Amiens for instance, at Rheims or Beauvais, may seem but formal, and to a large \\nextent reproducible, effects of mere architectural rule on a gigantic scale.  The somewhat Gothic soul of \\nGaston relished there something strange, or even bizarre, in the very manner in which the building set \\nitself, so broadly couchant, upon the earth; in the natural richness of tone on the masonry within; in its \\nvast echoing roof of timber, the \"forest,\" as it was called; in the mysterious maze traced upon its \\npavement; its maze-like crypt, centering in the shrine of the sibylline Notre-Dame, itself a natural or very \\nprimitive grotto or cave.  A few years were still to pass ere sacrilegious hands despoiled it on a religious \\npretext:--the catholic church must pay, even with the molten gold of her sanctuaries, the price of her \\ndefence in the civil war.  At present, it was such a treasure-house of medieval jewellery as we have to \\nmake a very systematic effort even to imagine.  The still extant register of its furniture and sacred apparel \\nleaves the soul of the ecclesiologist athirst.  \\nAnd it had another very remarkable difference from almost all Gothic churches: there were no graves \\nthere.  Its emptiness in this respect is due to no revolutionary or Huguenot desecration.  Once indeed, \\nabout this very time, a popular military leader had been interred with honour, within the precinct of the \\nhigh altar itself.  But not long afterwards, said the reverend canons, resenting on the part of their \\nimmaculate patroness this intrusion, the corpse itself, ill at ease, had protested, lifting up its hands above \\nthe surface of the pavement, as if to beg interment elsewhere; and Gaston could remember assisting, \\nawakened suddenly one night, at the removal of the remains to a more ordinary place of sepulture.  \\nAnd yet that lavish display of jewellers\\' work on the altars, in the chapels, the sacristies, of Our Lady\\'s \\nChurch, was but a framing for little else than dead people\\'s bones.  To Gaston, a piteous soul, with a \\ntouch also of that grim humour which, as we know, holds of pity, relic-worship came naturally.  At \\nDeux-manoirs too there had been relics, including certain broken children\\'s toys and some rude childish \\ndrawings, taken forth now and then with almost religious veneration, with trembling hands and renewal of \\nold grief, to his wondering awe at the greatness of men\\'s sorrows.  Yes! the pavement under one\\'s feet \\nhad once been, might become again for him, molten lava.  The look, the manner, of those who exposed \\nthese things, had been a revelation.  The abundant relics of the church of Chartres were for the most part \\nperished remnants of the poor human body itself; but, appertaining to persons long ago and of a far-off, \\nimmeasurable kind of sanctity, stimulated a more indifferent sort of curiosity, and seemed to bring the \\ndistant, the impossible, as with tangible evidence of fact, close to one\\'s side.  It was in one\\'s hand--the \\nfinger of an Evangelist!  The crowned head of Saint Lubin, bishop of Chartres long centuries since, but \\nstill able to preserve its wheat-stacks from fire; bones of the \"Maries,\" with some of the earth from their \\ngrave; these, and the like of these, was what the curious eye discerned in the recesses of those variously \\ncontrived reliquaries, great and small, glittering so profusely about the dusky church, itself ministering, by \\nits very shadows, to a certain appetite in the soul of Gaston for dimness--for a dim place like this--such as \\nhe had often prefigured to himself, albeit with some suspicion of what might seem a preference for \\ndarkness. Physical twilight we most of us love, in its season.  To him, that perpetual twilight came in close\\nidentity with its moral or intellectual counterpart, as the welcome requisite for that part of the soul which ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n Document(page_content='loves twilight, and is, in truth, never quite at rest out of it, through some congenital uneasiness or distress,\\nperhaps, in its processes of vision.  \\nAs complex, yet not less perfectly united under a single leading motive,--its sister volume, was the ritual \\norder of Notre-Dame de Chartres, a year-long dramatic action, in which every one had, and knew, his \\npart--the drama or \"mystery\" of Redemption, to the necessities of which the great church had shaped \\nitself.  All those various \"offices\" which, in Pontifical, Missal and Breviary, devout imagination had \\nelaborated from age to age with such a range of spiritual colour and light and shade, with so much poetic \\ntact in quotation, such a depth of insight into the Christian soul, had joined themselves harmoniously \\ntogether, one office ending only where another began, in the perpetual worship of this mother of \\nchurches, which had also its own picturesque peculiarities of \"use,\" proud of its maternal privilege therein.\\n And the music rose--warmed, expanded, or fell silent altogether--as the order of the year, the colours, the\\nwhole expression of things changed, gathering around the full mystic effulgence of the pontiff in his own \\nperson, while the sacred theme deepened at the great ecclesiastical seasons, when the aisles overflowed\\nwith a vast multitude, and like a court, combed, starched, rustling around him, Gaston and his fellows \\n\"served\" Monseigneur--they, zealous, ubiquitous, more prominent than ever, though for the most part \\nprofoundly irreverent, and, notwithstanding that, one and all, with what disdain of the untonsured laity!  \\nWell! what was of the past there--the actual stones of the temple and that sacred liturgical order--entered \\nreadily enough into Gaston\\'s mental kingdom, filling places prepared by the anticipations of his tranquil, \\ndream-struck youth.  It was the present, the uncalculated present, which now disturbed the complacent \\nhabit of his thoughts, proposing itself, importunately, in the living forms of his immediate companions, in \\nthe great clerical body of which he was become a part, in the people of Chartres itself (none the less \\nanimated because provincial) as a thing, alien at a thousand points from his preconceptions of life, to be \\njudged by him, to be rejected or located within.  How vivid, how delightful, they were!--the other forty-nine \\nof the fifty lads who had come hither, after the old- fashioned way, to serve in the household of \\nMonseigneur by way of an \"institution\" in learning and good manners, as to which a grave national \\nassembly, more than three centuries before the States- General of 1789, had judged French youth of \\nquality somewhat behindhand, recommending king and nobles to take better care for the future of their \\neducation, \"to the end that, enlightened and moralised, they might know their duties, and be less likely to \\nabuse their privileges.\"  \\nAnd how becomingly that cleric pride, that self-respecting quiet, sat upon their high-bred figures, their \\nangelic, unspoiled faces, saddened transiently as they came under the religious spell for a moment.  As \\nfor Gaston, they welcomed him with perfect friendliness, kept their best side foremost for an hour, and \\nwould not leave his very dreams.  In absolute unconsciousness, they had brought from their remote old \\nhomes all varieties of hereditary gifts, vices, distinctions, dark fates, mercy, cruelty, madness.  Appetite \\nand vanity abounded, but with an abundant superficial grace, befitting a generation which, as by some \\naesthetic sense in the air, made the most of the pleasant outsides of life.  All the various traits of the dying\\nMiddle Age were still in evidence among them, in all their crude effectiveness; only, blent, like rusty old \\narmour wreathed in flowers, with the peculiar fopperies of the time, shrewdly divined from a distance, as \\nhappens with competent youth. To be in Paris itself, amid the full, delightful, fragrance of those dainty \\nvisible things which Huguenots despised:--that, surely, were the sum of good-fortune!  Half-clerical, they \\nloved nevertheless the touch of steel; had a laughing joy in trifling with its latent soul of destruction.  In \\nmimicry of the great world, they had their leaders, so inscrutably self-imposed:--instinctively, they felt and \\nunderwent that mystery of leadership, with its consequent heats of spirit, its tides and changes of \\ninfluence.  \\nOn the other hand also, to Gaston, dreamily observant, it was quaint, likeable, the way they had of \\nreproducing, unsuspectingly, the humours of animal nature.  Does not the anthropologist tell us of a \\nheraldry, with a large assortment of heraldic beasts, to be found among savage or half-savage peoples, \\nas the \"survival\" of a period when men were nearer than they are or seem to be now, to the irrational \\nworld?  Throughout the sprightly movement of the lads\\' daily life it was as if their \"tribal\" pets or monsters \\nwere with or within them.  Tall Exmes, lithe and cruel like a tiger--it was pleasant to stroke him.  The tiger \\nwas there, the parrot, the hare, the goat of course, and certainly much apishness.  And, one and all, they \\nwere like the creatures, in their vagrant, short, memories, alert perpetually on the topmost crest of the day\\nand hour, transferred so heartlessly, so entirely, from yesterday to to-day. Yet out of them, sure of some \\nresponse, human heart did break:--in and around Camille Pontdormi, for instance, brilliant and ambitious, \\nyet so sensitive about his threadbare home, concerning which however he had made the whole company,', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 8}),\n Document(page_content='one by one, his confidants--so loyal to the people there, bursting into wild tears over the letter which \\nbrought the news of his younger brother\\'s death, visibly fretting over it long afterwards.  Still, for the most \\npart, in their perfect health, nothing seemed to reach them but their own boyish ordinances, their own \\narbitrary \"form.\"  It was an absolute indifference; most striking when they lifted their well-trained voices to \\nsing in choir, vacant as the sparrows, while the eloquent, far-reaching, aspiring words floated melodiously \\nfrom them, sometimes, with truly medieval license, singing to the sacred music those songs from the \\nstreets (no one cared to detect) which were really in their hearts.  A world of vanity and appetite, yet after \\nall of honesty with itself!  Like grown people, they were but playing a game, and meant to observe its \\nrules.  Say, rather, a world of honesty, and of courage!  They, at least, were not preoccupied all day long, \\nand, if they woke in the night, with the fear of death.  \\nIt was part of their precocious worldliness to recognise, to feel a little afraid of their new companion\\'s \\nintellectual power. Those obviously meditative souls, which seem \"not to sleep o\\' nights,\" seldom fail to \\nput others on their guard.  Who can tell what they may be judging, planning in silence, so near to one?  \\nLooking back long afterwards across the dark period that had intervened, Gaston could trace their ways \\nthrough the world.  Not many of them had survived to his own middle life.  Reappearing, from point to \\npoint, they connected themselves with the great crimes, the great tragedies of the time, as so many \\nbright-coloured threads in that sombre tapestry of human passion.  To recall in the obtuse, grieved, \\nmarred faces of uninteresting men or women, the disappointments, the sorrows, the tragic mistakes of the\\nchildren they were long ago; that is a good trick for taking our own sympathy by surprise, which Gaston \\npractised when he saw the last, or almost the last, of some of them, and felt a great pity, a great \\nindulgence.  \\nHere and now, at all events, carrying their cheerful tumult through all those quiet ecclesiastical places--the\\nbishop\\'s garden, the great sacristy, neat and clean in its brown, pensive lights, they seemed of a piece \\nwith the bright, simple, inanimate things, the toys, of nature.  They made one lively picture with the fruit \\nand wine they loved, the birds they captured, the buckets of clear water drawn for pastime from the great \\nwell, and Jean Sémur\\'s painted conjuring book stolen from the old sorceress, his grandmother, out of \\nwhich he told their fortunes; with the musical instruments of others; with their carefully hidden dice and \\nplaying-cards, worn or soiled by the fingers of the older gamesters who had discarded them.  Like their \\nelders, they read eagerly, in racy, new translations, old Greek and Latin books, with a delightful shudder \\nat the wanton paganism.  It was a new element of confusion in the presentment of that miniature world.  \\nThe classical enthusiasm laid hold on Gaston too, but essayed in vain to thrust out of him the medieval \\ncharacter of his experience, or put on quite a new face, insinuating itself rather under cover of the Middle \\nAge, still in occupation all around him. Venus, Mars, Aeneas, haunted, in contemporary shape, like ghosts\\nof folk one had known, the places with which he was familiar.  Latin might still seem the fittest language \\nfor oratory, sixteen hundred years after Cicero was dead; those old Roman pontiffs, draped grandly, sat in\\nthe stalls of the choir; Propertius made love to Cynthia in the raiment of the foppish Amadée; they played \\nTerence, and it was but a play within a play.  Above all, in natural, heartfelt kinship with their own violent \\nthough refined and cunning time, they loved every incident of soldiering; while the changes of the year, \\nthe lights, the shadows, the flickering fires of winter, with which Gaston had first associated his \\ncompanions, so full of artificial enjoyment for the well-to-do, added themselves pleasantly, by way of \\nshifting background, to the spectacular effect.  \\nIt was the brilliant surface with which the untried world confronted him.  Touch it where you might, you felt \\nthe resistant force of the solid matter of human experience--of human experience, in its strange mixture of\\nbeauty and evil, its sorrow, its ill-assorted fates, its pathetic acquiescence; above all, in its overpowering \\ncertainty, over against his own world of echoes and shadows, which perhaps only seemed to be so much \\nas echoes or shadows.  A nature with the capacity of worship, he was straightway challenged, as by a \\nrival new religion claiming to supersede the religion he knew, to identify himself conclusively with this so \\ntangible world, its suppositions, its issues, its risks.  Here was a world, certainly, which did not halt in \\nmeditation, but prompted one to make actual trial of it, with a liberty of heart which might likely enough \\ntraverse this or that precept (if it were not rather a mere scruple) of his earlier conscience.  These its \\nchildren, at all events, were, as he felt, in instinctive sympathy with its motions; had shrewd divinations of \\nthe things men really valued, and waited on them with unquestioning docility.  Two worlds, two \\nantagonistic ideals, were in evidence before him.  Could a third condition supervene, to mend their \\ndiscord, or only vex him perhaps, from time to time, with efforts towards an impossible adjustment?  \\nAt a later date, Monseigneur Charles Guillard, then Bishop of Chartres, became something like a ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n Document(page_content='Huguenot, and ceased, with the concurrence of ecclesiastical authority, from his high functions. Even now\\nhe was but a protégé of King Charles in his relations to a more than suspicious Pope; and a rumour of the\\nfact, reaching somehow these brisk young ears, had already set Gaston\\'s mind in action, tremblingly, as \\nto those small degrees, scarcely realisable perhaps one by one, though so immeasurable in their joint \\nresult, by which one might part from the \"living vine\"; and at times he started back, as if he saw his own \\nbenighted footsteps pacing lightly towards an awful precipice.  At present, indeed, the assumption that \\nthere was sanctity in everything the kindly prelate touched, was part of the well-maintained etiquette of the\\nlittle ecclesiastical court.  But, as you meet in the street faces that are like a sacrament, so there are \\nfaces, looks, tones of voice, among dignified priests as among other people, to hear or look upon which is\\nto feel the hypothesis of an unseen world impossible.  As he smiled amiably out of the midst of his \\npontifical array on Gaston\\'s scrupulous devotion, it was as if the old Roman augur smiled not only to his \\nfellow augur but to the entire assistant world.  In after years Gaston seemed to understand, and, as a \\nconsequence of understanding, to judge his old patron equitably: the religious sense too, had its various \\nspecies.  The nephew of his predecessor in the see, with a real sense of the divine world but as \\nsomething immeasurably distant, Monseigneur Guillard had been brought by maladroit worldly \\ngood-fortune a little too close to its immediate and visible embodiments.  From afar, you might trace the \\ndivine agency on its way.  But to touch, to handle it, with these fleshly hands:--well! for Monseigneur, that \\nwas by no means to believe because the thing was \"incredible, or absurd.\"  He had smiled, not certainly \\nfrom irreverence, nor (a prelate for half his life) in conscious incredulity, but only in mute surprise, at an \\nadministration of divine graces--this administration in which he was a high priest--in itself, to his quite \\nhonest thinking, so unfitting, so improbable.  And was it that Gaston too was a less independent ruler of \\nhis own mental world than he had fancied, that he derived his impressions of things not directly from \\nthem, but mediately from other people\\'s impressions about them, and he needed the pledge of their \\nassents to ratify his own?  Only, could that, after all, be a real sun, at which other people\\'s faces were not \\nirradiated?  And sometimes it seemed, with a riotous swelling of the heart, as if his own wondrous \\nappetite in these matters had been deadened by surfeit, and there would be a pleasant sense of liberty, of\\nescape out-of- doors, could he be as little touched as almost all other people by Our Lady\\'s Church, and \\nold associations, and all those relics, and those dark, close, fragrant aisles.  \\nAt such times, to recall the winged visitant, gentle, yet withal sensitive to offence, which had settled on his\\nyouth with so deep a sense of assurance, he would climb the tower of Jean de Beauce, then fresh in all \\nits array of airy staircase and pierced traceries, and great uncovered timbers, like some gigantic birdnest \\namid the stones, whence the large, quiet, country spaces became his own again, and the curious eye, at \\nleast, went home.  He was become well aware of the power of those familiar influences in restoring \\nequanimity, as he might have used a medicine or a wine.  At each ascending storey, as the flight of the \\nbirds, the scent of the fields, swept past him, till he stood at last amid the unimpeded light and air of the \\nwatch- chamber above the great bells, some coil of perplexity, of unassimilable thought or fact, fell away \\nfrom him.  He saw the distant paths, and seemed to hear the breeze piping suddenly upon them under the\\ncloudless sky, on its unseen, capricious way through those vast reaches of atmosphere.  At this height, \\nthe low ring of blue hills was visible, with suggestions of that south-west country of peach-blossom and \\nwine which had sometimes decoyed his thoughts towards the sea, and beyond it to \"that new world of the \\nIndies,\" which was held to explain a certain softness in the air from that quarter, even in the most \\nvehement weather.  Amid those vagrant shadows and shafts of light must be Deux-manoirs, the deserted \\nrooms, the gardens, the graves.  In mid-distance, even then a funeral procession was on its way humbly \\nto one of the village churchyards. He seemed almost to hear the words across the stillness.  \\nThey identified themselves, as with his own earliest prepossessions, so also with what was apt to present \\nitself as being the common human prepossession--a certain finally authoritative common sense upon the \\nquiet experience of things--the oldest, the most authentic, of all voices, audible always, if one stepped \\naside for a moment and got one\\'s ears into what might after all be their normal condition.  It might be \\nheard, it would seem, in proportion as men were in touch with the Earth itself, in country life, in manual \\nwork upon it, above all by the open grave, as if, reminiscent of some older, deeper, more permanent \\nground of fact, it whispered then oracularly a certain secret to those who came into such close contact \\nwith it.  Persistent after-thought!  Would it always survive, amid the indifference of others, amid the \\nverdicts of the world, amid a thousand doubts?  It seemed to have found, and filled to overflowing, the \\nsoul of one amiable little child who had a kind of genius for tranquillity, and on his first coming hither had \\nled Gaston to what he held to be the choicest, pleasantest places, as being impregnable by noise.  In his ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n Document(page_content='small stock of knowledge, he knew, like all around him, that he was going to die, and took kindly to the \\nthought of a small grave in the little green close, as to a natural sleeping-place, in which he would be at \\nhome beforehand.  Descending from the tower, Gaston knew he should find the child seated alone, \\nenjoying the perfect quiet of the warm afternoon, for all the world was absent--gone forth to receive or \\ngaze at a company of distinguished pilgrims.  \\nComing, sometimes with immense prelude and preparation, as when King Charles himself arrived to \\nreplace an image disfigured by profane Huguenots, sometimes with the secrecy and suddenness of an \\napparition vanished before the public was aware, the pilgrims to \"Our Lady under the Earth\" were the \\nstanding resource of those (such there were at Chartres as everywhere else) who must needs depend for \\nthe interest of their existence on the doings of their neighbours.  A motley host, only needing their \\nChaucer to figure as a looking-glass of life, type against type, they brought with them, on the one hand, \\nthe very presence and perfume of Paris, the centre of courtly propriety and fashion; on the other hand, \\nwith faces which seemed to belong to another age, curiosities of existence from remote provinces of \\nFrance, or Europe, from distant, half-fabulous lands, remoter still. Jules Damville, who would have liked \\nbest to be a sailor, to command, not in any spiritual ark, but in the French fleet--should half-ruined France \\never come to have one--led his companions one evening to inspect a strange maritime personage, stout \\nand square, returned, contrary to all expectation, after ten years\\' captivity among the savages of Florida, \\nkneeling among the lights at the shrine, with the frankness of a good child, his hair like a mat, his hands \\ntattooed, his mahogany face seamed with a thousand weather- wrinklings, his outlandish offerings lying \\ndisplayed around him.  \\nLooking, listening, as they served them in the episcopal guest- chamber, those young clerks made \\nwonderful leaps, from time to time, in manly knowledge.  With what eager shrewdness they noted, \\ndiscussed, reproduced, the manners and attire of their pilgrim guests, sporting what was to their liking \\ntherein in the streets of Chartres.  The more cynical or supercilious pilgrim would sometimes present \\nhimself--a personage oftenest of high ecclesiastical station, like the eminent translator of Plutarch, Amyot,\\nafterwards Bishop of Auxerre, who seemed to care little for shrine or relic, but lingered long over certain \\ndim manuscripts in the canonical library, where our scholarly Gaston was of service, helping him directly \\nto what he desired to see.  And one morning early, visible at a distance to all the world, risen betimes to \\ngaze, the Queen-mother and her three sons were kneeling there--yearning, greedy, as ever, for a \\nhundred diverse, perhaps incompatible, things.  It was at the beginning of that winter of the great siege of \\nChartres, the morning on which the child Guy Debreschescourt died in his sleep.  His tiny body--the \\nplacid, massive, baby head still one broad smile, the rest of him wrapped round together like a \\nchrysalis--was put to rest finally, in a fold of the winding-sheet of a very aged person, deceased at the \\nsame hour.  \\nFor a hard winter, like that famous winter of 1567, the hardest that had been known for fifty years, makes \\nan end of the weak--the aged, the very young.  To the robust, how pleasant had the preparation for it \\nseemed--the scent of the first wood-fire upon the keen October air; the earth turning from grey to black \\nunder the plough; the great stacks of fuel, come down lazily from the woods of Le Perche, along the \\nwinding Eure; its wholesome perfume; the long, soothing nights, and early twilight.  The mind of Gaston, \\nfor one, was touched by the sense of some remote and delicate beauty in these things, like magicians\\' \\nwork, like an effect of magic as being extorted from unsuspected sources.  \\nWhat winter really brought however, was the danger and vexation of a great siege.  The householders of \\ncatholic Chartres had watched the forces of their Huguenot enemies gathering from this side and that; \\nand at last the dreaded circle was complete.  They were prisoners like the rest, Gaston and the \\ngrandparents, shut up in their little hotel; and Gaston, face to face with it, understood at last what war \\nreally means.  After all, it took them by surprise.  It was early in the day.  A crowd of worshippers filled the \\nchurch of Sainte-Foy, built partly upon the ramparts; and at the conclusion of the mass, the Sacrament \\nwas to be carried to a sick person.  Touched by unusual devotion at this perilous time, the whole \\nassembly rose to escort the procession on its way, passing out slowly, group after group, as if by \\nmechanical instinct, the more reluctant led on by the general consent.  Gaston, the last lingerer, halting to \\nlet others proceed quietly before him, turned himself about to gaze upon the deserted church, half \\ntempted to remain, ere he too stepped forth lightly and leisurely, when under a shower of massy stones \\nfrom the coulevrines or great cannon of the besiegers, the entire roof of the place sank into the empty \\nspace behind him.  But it was otherwise in a neighbouring church, crushed, in a similar way, with all its \\ngood people, not long afterwards.  ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n Document(page_content='And in the midst of the siege, with all its tumult about her, the old grandmother died, to the undissembled \\nsorrow of Gaston, bereft, unexpectedly as it seemed, of the gentle creature, to whom he had always \\nturned for an affection, that had been as no other in its absolute incapacity of offence.  A tear upon the \\ncheek, like the bark of a tree, testified to some unfulfilled hope, something wished for but not to be, which \\nleft resignation, by nature or grace, still imperfect, and made death at fourscore years and ten seem, after \\nall, like a premature summons in the midst of one\\'s days.  For a few hours, the peace which followed \\nbrought back to the face a protesting gleam of youth, far antecedent to anything Gaston could possibly \\nhave remembered there, moving him to a pity, a peculiar sense of pleading helplessness, which to the \\nend of his life was apt to revive at the sight (it might be in an animal) of what must perforce remember that\\nit had been young but was old.  \\nThat broken link with life seemed to end some other things for him. As one puts away the toys of \\nchildhood, so now he seemed to discard what had been the central influence of his earlier youth, what \\nmore than anything else had stirred imagination and brought the consciousness of his own life warm and \\nfull.  Gazing now upon the \"holy and beautiful place,\" as he had gazed on the dead face, for a moment he \\nseemed to anticipate the indifference of age.  And when not long after the rude hands of catholics \\nthemselves, at their wits\\' end for the maintenance of the \"religious war,\" spoiled it of the accumulated \\ntreasure of centuries, leaving Notre-Dame de Chartres in the bareness with which we see it to-day, he \\nhad no keen sense of personal loss.  \\n  \\nCHAPTER III.  MODERNITY  \\n  \\nThe besieging armies disappeared like the snow, leaving city and suburb in all the hardened soilure of \\nwar and winter, which only the torrents of spring would carry away.  And the spring came suddenly: it was \\npleasant, after that long confinement, to walk afar securely through its early fervours.  Gaston too went \\nforth on his way home, not alone.  Three chosen companions went with him, pledged to the old manor for \\nmonths to come; its lonely ancient master welcoming readily the tread of youth about him.  \\n\"The Triumvirate\":--so their comrades had been pleased to call the three; that term (delightful touch of \\nclassic colour on one\\'s own trite but withal pedantic age) being then familiar, as the designation of three \\nconspicuous agents on the political scene of the generation just departing.  Only, these young Latinists \\nwent back for the associations of the word to its Roman original, to the three gallants of the distant time, \\nrather than to those native French heroes--Montmorenci, Saint-André, Guise--too close to them to seem \\nreally heroic.  Mark Antony, knight of Venus, of Cleopatra; shifty Lepidus; bloody, yellow-haired Augustus,\\nso worldly and so fine; you might find their mimic semblance, more easily than any suggestion of that \\nthreadbare triad of French adventurers, in the unfolding manhood of Jasmin, Amadée, and Camille.  \\nThey had detached themselves by an irresistible natural effectiveness from the surface of that youthful \\nscholastic world around the episcopal throne of Chartres, carrying its various aptitudes as if to a perfect \\ntriple flower; restless Amadée de l\\'Autrec, who was to be a soldier, dazzled early into dangerous, \\nrebellious paths by the iron ideal of the soldiers of \"the religion,\" and even now fitting his blond prettiness \\nto airs of Huguenot austerity; Camille Pontdormi, who meant to be a lawyer in an age in which certain \\nlegists had asserted an audacity of genius after a manner very captivating to youth with any appetite for \\npredominance over its fellows--already winsomely starched a little, amid his courtly finery, of garb, and \\nmanner, and phrase; Jasmin de Villebon, who hardly knew what he meant to be, except perhaps a \\npoet--himself, certainly, a poem for any competent reader.  Vain,--yes! a little; and mad, said his \\ncompanions, of course, with his clinging, exigent, lover\\'s ways.  It was he who had led the others on this \\nvisit to Gaston de Latour. Threads to be cut short, one by one, before his eyes, the three would cross and \\nrecross, gaily, pathetically, in the tapestry of Gaston\\'s years; and, divided far asunder afterwards, seemed\\nat this moment, moving there before him in the confidential talk he could not always share, inseparably \\nlinked together, like some complicated pictorial arabesque, under the common light, of their youth, and of \\nthe morning, and of their sympathetic understanding of the visible world.  \\nSo they made their way, under the rows of miraculous white thorn- blossom, and through the green \\nbillows, at peace just then, though the war still blazed or smouldered along the southern banks of the \\nLoire and far beyond, and it was with a delightful sense of peril, of prowess attested in the facing of it, that\\nthey passed from time to time half-ruined or deserted farm-buildings where the remnants of the armies \\nmight yet be lingering.  It was Jasmin, poetic Jasmin, who, in giving Gaston the book he now carried ever \\nready to hand, had done him perhaps the best of services, for it had proved the key to a new world of ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n Document(page_content='seemingly boundless intellectual resources, and yet with a special closeness to visible or sensuous \\nthings;--the scent and colour of the field-flowers, the amorous business of the birds, the flush and \\nre-fledging of the black earth itself in that fervent springtide, which was therefore unique in Gaston\\'s \\nmemory.  It was his intellectual springtide; as people look back to a physical spring, which for once in ten \\nor fifteen years, for once in a lifetime, was all that spring could be.  \\nThe book was none other than Pierre de Ronsard\\'s \"Odes,\" with \"Mignonne!  allons voir si la Rose,\" and \\n\"The Skylark\" and the lines to April--itself verily like nothing so much as a jonquil, in its golden-green \\nbinding and yellow edges and perfume of the place where it had lain--sweet, but with something of the \\nsickliness of all spring flowers since the days of Proserpine.  Just eighteen years old, and the work of the \\npoet\\'s own youth, it took possession of Gaston with the ready intimacy of one\\'s equal in age, fresh at \\nevery point; and he experienced what it is the function of contemporary poetry to effect anew for sensitive \\nyouth in each succeeding generation.  The truant and irregular poetry of his own nature, all in solution \\nthere, found an external and authorised mouthpiece, ranging itself rightfully, as the latest achievement of \\nhuman soul in this matter, along with the consecrated poetic voices of the past.  \\nPoetry!  Hitherto it had seemed hopelessly chained to the bookshelf, like something in a dead language, \\n\"dead, and shut up in reliquaries of books,\" or like those relics \"one may only see through a little pane of \\nglass,\" as one of its recent \"liberators\" had said.  Sure, apparently, of its own \"niche in the temple of \\nFame,\" the recognised poetry of literature had had the pretension to defy or discredit, as depraved and \\nirredeemably vulgar, the poetic motions in the living genius of to-day.  Yet the genius of to-day, extant and\\nforcible, the wakeful soul of present time consciously in possession, would assert its poetic along with all \\nits other rights; and in regard to the curiosity, the intellectual interest, of Gaston, for instance, it had of \\ncourse the advantage of being close at hand, with the effectiveness of a personal presence.  Studious \\nyouth, indeed, on its mettle about \"scholarship,\" though actually of listless humour among books that \\ncertainly stirred the past, makes a docile act of faith regarding the witchery, the thaumaturgic powers, of \\nVirgil, or may we say of Shakespeare?  Yet how faint and dim, after all, the sorrows of Dido, of Juliet, the \\ntravail of Aeneas, beside quite recent things felt or done--stories which, floating to us on the light current \\nof to-day\\'s conversation, leave the soul in a flutter! At best, poetry of the past could move one with no \\nmore directness than the beautiful faces of antiquity which are not here for us to see and unaffectedly love\\nthem.  Gaston\\'s demand (his youth only conforming to pattern therein) was for a poetry, as veritable, as \\nintimately near, as corporeal, as the new faces of the hour, the flowers of the actual season.  The poetry \\nof mere literature, like the dead body, could not bleed, while there was a heart, a poetic heart, in the living \\nworld, which beat, bled, spoke with irresistible power.  Elderly people, Virgil in hand, might assert \\nprofessionally that the contemporary age, an age, of course, of little people and things, deteriorate since \\nthe days of their own youth, must necessarily be unfit for poetic uses.  But then youth, too, had its \\nperpetual part to play, protesting that, after all said, the sun in the air, and in its own veins, was still found \\nto be hot, still begetting, upon both alike, flowers and fruit; nay! visibly new flowers, and fruit richer than \\never.  Privately, in fact, Gaston had conceived of a poetry more thaumaturgic than could be anything of \\nearlier standing than himself.  The age renews itself; and in immediate derivation from it a novel poetry \\nalso grows superb and large, to fill a certain mental situation made ready in advance. Yes! the \\nacknowledged, and, so to call it, legitimate, poetry of literature was but a thing he might sip at, like some \\nsophisticated rarity in the way of wine, for example, pleasing the acquired taste. It was another sort of \\npoetry, unexpressed, perhaps inexpressible, certainly not hitherto made known in books, that must drink \\nup and absorb him, like the joyful air--him, and the earth, with its deeds, its blossoms, and faces.  \\nIn such condition of mind, how deeply, delightfully, must the poetry of Ronsard and his fellows have \\nmoved him, when he became aware, as from age to age inquisitive youth by good luck does become \\naware, of the literature of his own day, confirming--more than confirming-- anticipation!  Here was a poetry\\nwhich boldly assumed the dress, the words, the habits, the very trick, of contemporary life, and turned \\nthem into gold.  It took possession of the lily in one\\'s hand, and projecting it into a visionary distance, shed\\nupon the body of the flower the soul of its beauty.  Things were become at once more deeply sensuous \\nand more deeply ideal.  As at the touch of a wizard, something more came into the rose than its own \\nnatural blush. Occupied so closely with the visible, this new poetry had so profound an intuition of what \\ncan only be felt, and maintained that mood in speaking of such objects as wine, fruit, the plume in the cap,\\nthe ring on the finger.  And still that was no dubious or generalised form it gave to flower or bird, but the \\nexact pressure of the Jay at the window; you could count the petals,--of the exact natural number; no \\nexpression could be too faithful to the precise texture of things; words, too, must embroider, be twisted ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 13}),\n Document(page_content='and spun, like silk or golden hair.  Here were real people, in their real, delightful attire, and you \\nunderstood how they moved; the visible was more visible than ever before, just because soul had come to\\nits surface.  The juice in the flowers, when Ronsard named them, was like wine or blood.  It was such a \\ncoloured thing; though the grey things also, the cool things, all the fresher for the contrast--with a \\nfreshness, again, that seemed to touch and cool the soul--found their account there; the clangorous \\npassage of the birds at night foretokening rain, the moan of the wind at the door, the wind\\'s self made \\nvisible over the yielding corn.  \\nIt was thus Gaston understood the poetry of Ronsard, generously expanding it to the full measure of its \\nintention.  That poetry, too, lost its thaumaturgic power in turn, and became mere literature in exchange \\nfor life, partly in the natural revolution of poetic taste, partly for its faults.  Faults and all, however, Gaston \\nloyally accepted it; those faults--the lapse of grace into affectation, of learning into pedantry, of exotic \\nfineness into a trick--counting with him as but the proof of faith to its own dominant positions. They were \\nbut characteristics, needing no apology with the initiated, or welcome even, as savouring of the master\\'s \\npeculiarities of perfection.  He listened, he looked round freely, but always now with the ear, the eye, of \\nhis favourite poet.  It had been a lesson, a doctrine, the communication of an art,--the art of placing the \\npleasantly aesthetic, the welcome, elements of life at an advantage, in one\\'s view of it, till they seemed to \\noccupy the entire surface; and he was sincerely grateful for an undeniable good service.  \\nAnd yet the gifted poet seemed but to have spoken what was already in Gaston\\'s own mind, what he had \\nlonged to say, had been just going to say; so near it came, that it had the charm of a discovery of one\\'s \\nown.  That was an illusion, perhaps; it was because the poet told one so much about himself, making so \\nfree a display of what though personal was very contagious; of his love-secrets especially, how love and \\nnothing else filled his mind.  He was in truth but \"love\\'s secretary,\" noting from hour to hour its minutely \\nchanging fortunes.  Yes! that was the reason why visible, audible, sensible things glowed so brightly, why \\nthere was such luxury in sounds, words, rhythms, of the new light come on the world, of that wonderful \\nfreshness.  With a masterly appliance of what was near and familiar, or again in the way of bold \\ninnovation, he found new words for perennially new things, and the novel accent awakened \\nlong-slumbering associations.  Never before had words, single words, meant so much. What expansion, \\nwhat liberty of heart, in speech: how associable to music, to singing, the written lines!  He sang of the lark,\\nand it was the lark\\'s voluble self.  The physical beauty of humanity lent itself to every object, animate or \\ninanimate, to the very hours and lapses and changes of time itself.  An almost burdensome fulness of \\nexpression haunted the gestures, the very dress, the personal ornaments, of the people on the highway.  \\nEven Jacques Bonhomme at his labour, or idling for an hour, borrowed from his love, homely as it was, a \\ntouch of dignity or grace, and some secret of utterance, which made one think of Italy or Greece.  The \\nvoice of the shepherd calling, the chatter of the shepherdess turning her spindle, seemed to answer, or \\nwait for answer,--to be fragments of love\\'s ideal and eternal communing.  \\nIt was the power of \"modernity,\" as renewed in every successive age for genial youth, protesting, defiant \\nof all sanction in these matters, that the true \"classic\" must be of the present, the force and patience of \\npresent time.  He had felt after the thing, and here it was,--the one irresistible poetry there had ever been, \\nwith the magic word spoken in due time, transforming his own age and the world about him, presenting its\\neveryday touch, the very trick one knew it by, as an additional grace, asserting the latent poetic rights of \\nthe transitory, the fugitive, the contingent.  Poetry need no longer mask itself in the habit of a bygone day: \\nGaston could but pity the people of bygone days for not being above-ground to read.  Here, was a \\ndiscovery, a new faculty, a privileged apprehension, to be conveyed in turn to one and to another, to be \\npropagated for the imaginative regeneration of the world.  It was a manner, a habit of thought, which \\nwould invade ordinary life, and mould that to its intention. In truth, all the world was already aware, and \\ndelighted.  The \"school\" was soon to pay the penalty of that immediate acceptance, that intimate fitness to\\nthe mind of its own time, by sudden and profound neglect, as a thing preternaturally tarnished and tame, \\nlike magic youth, or magic beauty, turned in a moment by magic\\'s own last word into withered age.  But \\nthen, to the liveliest spirits of that time it had seemed nothing less than \"impeccable,\" after the manner of \\nthe great sacred products of the past, though in a living tongue. Nay! to Gaston for one, the power of the \\nold classic poetry itself was explained by the reflex action of the new, and might seem to justify its \\npretensions at last.  \\nFrom the poem fancy wandered to the poet, and curious youth would fain see the writer in person,--what \\na poet was like, with anxious surmises, this way and that, as to the degree in which the precious mental \\nparticles might be expected to have wrought up the outward presence to their own high quality.  A ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n Document(page_content='creature of the eye, in this case at least, the intellectual hold on him being what it was, Gaston had no fear\\nof disillusion.  His poetic readings had borrowed an additional relish from the genial, companionable, \\nmanner of his life at this time, taking him into the remotest corners of the vast level land, and its outer ring \\nof blue up-lands; amid which, as he rode one day with \"the three,\" towards perfectly new prospects, he \\nhad chanced on some tangible rumour of the great poet\\'s present abode.  The hill they had mounted at \\nleisure, in talk with a village priest, dropped suddenly upon a vague tract of wood and pasture, with a dark\\nridge beyond towards the south-west; and the black notch, which broke its outline against the mellow \\nspace of evening light, was the steeple of the priory of Croix-val, of which reverend body Pierre de \\nRonsard, although a layman, was, by special favour of King Charles, Superior.  \\nThough a formal peace was come, though the primary movers of war had taken hands or kissed each \\nother, and were exchanging suspicious courtesies, yet the unquiet temper of war was still abroad \\neverywhere, with an after-crop of miserable incidents.  The captainless national and mercenary soldiers \\nwere become in large number thieves or beggars, and the peasant\\'s hand sank back to the tame labour \\nof the plough reluctantly.  Relieved a little by the sentimental humour of the hour, lending, as Ronsard \\nprompted, a poetic and always amorous interest to everything around him, poor Gaston\\'s very human \\nsoul was vexed nevertheless at the spectacle of the increased hardness of human life, with certain \\nmisgivings from time to time at the contrast of his own luxurious tranquillity.  The homeless woman \\nsuckling her babe at the roadside, the grey-beard hasting before the storm, the tattered fortune-teller who,\\nwhen he shook his head at her proposal to \"read his hand,\" assured him (perhaps with some insight into \\nhis character) \"You do that\"--you shake your head, negatively--\"too much!\" these, and the like, might \\ncount as fitting human accidents in an impassioned landscape picture.  And his new imaginative culture \\nhad taught him to value \"surprises\" in nature itself; the quaint, exciting charm of the mistletoe in the wood,\\nof the blossom before the leaf, the cry of passing birds at night.  Nay! the most familiar details of nature, \\nits daily routine of light and darkness, beset him now with a kind of troubled and troubling eloquence.  The\\nrain, the first streak of dawn, the very sullenness of the sky, had a power, only to be described by saying \\nthat they seemed to be moral facts.  \\nOn his way at last to gaze on the abode of the new hero or demi-god of poetry, Gaston perceives \\nincreasingly, as another excellence of his verse, how truthful, how close it is to the minute fact of the \\nscene around; as there are pleasant wines which, expressing the peculiar quality of their native soil, lose \\ntheir special pleasantness away from home.  The physiognomy of the scene was changed; the plain of La\\nBeauce had ruffled itself into low green hills and gently winding valleys, with clear, quick water, and \\nfanciful patches of heath and wood-land.  Here and there a secular oak tree maintained a solitude around \\nit.  It was the district of the \"little river Loir\"--the Vendomois; and here, in its own country, the new poetry, \\nnotwithstanding its classic elegance, might seem a native wild flower, modest enough.  \\nHe came riding with his companions towards evening along the road which had suddenly abandoned its \\nday-long straightness for wanton curves and ascents; and there, as an owl on the wing cried softly, \\nbeyond the tops of the spreading poplars was the west front, silver-grey, and quiet, inexpressibly quiet, \\nwith its worn, late- gothic \"flamings\" from top to bottom, as full of reverie to Gaston\\'s thinking as the \\nenchanted castle in a story-book.  The village lay thinly scattered around the wide, grass-grown space; \\nbelow was the high espaliered garden-wall, and within it, visible through the open doors, a gaunt figure, \\nhook-nosed, like a wizard, at work with the spade, too busily to turn and look.  Or was it that he did not \\nhear at all the question repeated thrice:--Could one see His Reverence the Prior, at least in his convent \\nchurch?  \"You see him\" was the answer, as a face, all nerve, distressed nerve, turned upon them not \\nunkindly, the vanity of the great man aware and pleasantly tickled. The unexpected incident had \\nquickened a prematurely aged pulse, and in reward for their good service the young travellers were \\nbidden carry their equipment, not to the village inn, but to the guest- chamber of the half-empty priory.  \\nThe eminent man of letters, who had been always an enthusiastic gardener, though busy just now not \\nwith choice flowers but with salutary kitchen-stuff, working indeed with much effort, to counteract the gout,\\nwas ready enough in his solitude to make the most of chance visitors, especially youthful ones.  A bell \\nclanged; he laid aside the spade, and casting an eye at the whirling weather-vanes announced that it \\nwould snow.  There had been no \"sunset.\"  They had travelled away imperceptibly from genial afternoon \\ninto a world of ashen evening.  \\nThe enemies of the lay Prior, satirists literary and religious, falsely made a priest of him, a priest who \\nshould have sacrificed a goat to pagan Bacchus.  And in truth the poet, for a time a soldier, and all his life \\na zealous courtier, had always been capable, as a poet should be, of long-sustained meditation, adapting ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n Document(page_content='himself easily enough to the habits of the \"religious,\" following attentively the choir-services in their \\nchurch, of which he was a generous benefactor, and to which he presently proceeded for vespers.  \\nGaston and \"the three\" sat among the Brethren, tempting curious eyes, in the stalls of the half-lighted \\nchoir, while in purple cope and jaunty biretta the lay Prior \"assisted,\" his confidentiaire, or priestly \\nsubstitute, officiating at the altar.  The long, sad, Lenten office over, an invitation to supper followed, for \\nRonsard still loved, in his fitful retirements at one or another of his numerous benefices, to give way to the\\nchance recreation of flattering company, and these gay lads\\' enthusiasm for his person was obvious.  And\\nas for himself, the great poet, with his bodily graces and airs of court, had always possessed the gift of \\npleasing those who encountered him.  \\nThe snow was falling now in big, slow flakes, a great fire blazing under the chimney with its cipher and \\nenigmatic motto, as they sat down to the leek-soup, the hard eggs, and the salad grown and gathered by \\ntheir host\\'s own hands.  The long stone passages through which they passed from church, with the \\nnarrow brown doors of the monks\\' dormitories one after another along the white-washed wall, made the \\ncoquetries of the Prior\\'s own distant apartment all the more reassuring.  You remembered that from his \\nninth year he had been the pet of princesses, the favourite of kings.  Upon the cabinets, chests, \\nbook-cases, around, were ranged the souvenirs received from various royal persons, including three \\nkings of France, the fair Queen of Scots, Elizabeth of England; and the conversation fell to, and was kept \\ngoing by, the precious contents of the place where they were sitting, the books printed and bound as they \\nhad never been before--books which meant assiduous study, the theory of poetry with Ronsard always \\naccompanying its practice--delicate things of art, which beauty had handled or might handle, the pictured \\nfaces on the walls, in their frames of reeded ebony or jewelled filigree.  There was the Minerva, decreed \\nhim at a conference of the elegant, pedantic \"Jeux Floraux,\" which had proclaimed Pierre de Ronsard \\n\"Prince of Poets.\" The massive silver image Ronsard had promptly offered to his patron King Charles; but \\nin vain, for, though so greatly in want of ready-money that he melted down church ornaments and exacted\\n\"black\" contributions from the clergy, one of the things in which Charles had ever been sincere was a \\nreverence for literature.  \\nSo there it stood, doing duty for Our Lady, with gothic crown and a fresh sprig of consecrated box, \\nbringing the odd, enigmatic physiognomy, preferred by the art of that day, within the sphere of religious \\ndevotion.  The King\\'s manuscript, declining, in verse really as good as Ronsard\\'s, the honour not meant \\nfor him, might be read, attached to the pedestal.  The ladies of his own verse, Marie, Cassandre, and the \\nrest, idols one after another of a somewhat artificial and for the most part unrequited love, from the \\nAngevine maiden--La petite pucelle Angevine--who had vexed his young soul by her inability to yield him \\nmore than a faint Platonic affection, down to Helen, to whom he had been content to propose no other, \\ngazed, more impassibly than ever, from the walls.  \\nThey might have been sisters, those many successive loves, or one and the same lady over and over \\nagain, in slightly varied humour and attire perhaps, at the different intervals of some rather lengthy, \\nmimetic masque of love, to which the theatrical dress of that day was appropriate; for the mannered \\nItalian, or Italianised, artists, including the much-prized, native Janet, with his favourite water- green \\nbackgrounds, aware of the poet\\'s predilection, had given to all alike the same brown eyes and tender \\neyelids and golden hair and somewhat ambered paleness, varying only the curious artifices of the \\ndress--knots, and nets, and golden spider-work, and clear, flat stones.  Dangerous guests in that simple, \\ncloistral place, Sibyls of the Renaissance on a mission from Italy to France, to Gaston one and all seemed\\nunder the burden of some weighty message concerning a world unknown to him; the stealthy lines of \\ncheek and brow contriving to express it, while the lips and eyes only smiled, not quite honestly.  It had \\nbeen a learned love, with undissembled \"hatred of the vulgar.\"  Three royal Margarets, much-praised \\npearls of three succeeding generations (for to the curious in these objects purity is far from being the only \\nmeasure of value) asserted charms a thought more frank, or French, though still gracefully pedantic, with \\ntheir quaintly kerchiefed books--books of what?--in their pale hands. Among the ladies, on the pictured \\nwall as in life, were the poet\\'s male companions, stirring memories of a more material sort, though their \\ncommon interest had been poetry--memories of that \"Bohemia,\" which even a prince of court poets had \\nfrequented when he was young, of his cruder youthful vanities. In some cases the date of death was \\ninscribed below.  \\nOne there was among them, the youngest, of whose genial fame to come this experienced judge of men \\nand books, two years before \"St. Bartholomew\\'s,\" was confident--a crowned boy, King Charles himself. \\nHere perhaps was the single entirely disinterested sentiment of the poet\\'s life, wholly independent of a ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 16}),\n Document(page_content='long list of benefits, or benefices; for the younger had turned winsomely, appealingly, to the elder, who, \\nforty years of age, feeling chilly at the thought, had no son.  And of one only of those companions did the \\nmemory bring a passing cloud.  It was long ago, on a journey, that he had first spoken, accidentally, with \\nJoachim du Bellay, whose friendship had been the great intellectual fortune of his life.  For a moment one \\nsaw the encounter at the wayside inn, in the broad, gay morning, a quarter of a century since; and there \\nwas the face--deceased at thirty-five.  Pensive, plaintive, refined by sickness, of exceeding delicacy, it \\nmust from the first have been best suited to the greyness of an hour like this.  To-morrow, where will be \\nthe snow?  \\nThe leader in that great poetic battle of the Pleiad, their host himself (he explained the famous device, and\\nnamed the seven chief stars in the constellation) was depicted appropriately, in veritable armour, with \\nantique Roman cuirass of minutely inlaid gold, and flowered mantle; the crisp, ceremonial, laurel-wreath \\nof the Roman conqueror lying on the audacious, over-developed brows, above the great hooked nose of \\npractical enterprise.  In spite of his pretension to the Epicurean conquest of a kingly indifference of mind, \\nthe portrait of twenty years ago betrayed, not less than the living face with its roving, astonished eyes, the \\nhaggard soul of a haggard generation, whose eagerly-sought refinements had been after all little more \\nthan a theatrical make-believe--an age of wild people, of insane impulse, of homicidal mania.  The \\nsweet-souled songster had no more than others attained real calm in it.  Even in youth nervous distress \\nhad been the chief facial characteristic. Triumphant, nevertheless, in his battle for Greek beauty--for the \\nnaturalisation of Greek beauty in the brown cloud-lands of the North- -he might have been thinking, \\ncontemptuously, of barking little Saint-Gelais, or of Monsieur Marot\\'s pack-thread poems.  He, for his part,\\nhad always held that poetry should be woven of delicate silk, or of fine linen, or at least of good \\nhome-spun worsted.  \\nTo Gaston, yielding himself to its influence, for a moment the scene around seemed unreal: an exotic, \\nembalming air, escaped from some old Greek or Roman pleasure-place, had turned the poet\\'s workroom \\ninto a strange kind of private sanctuary, amid these rude conventual buildings, with the March wind aloud \\nin the chimneys. Notwithstanding, what with the long day\\'s ride, the keen evening, they had done justice \\nto the monastic fare, the \"little\" wine of the country, the cream, the onions,--fine Camille, and dainty \\nJasmin, and the poet turned to talk upon gardening, concerning which he could tell them a thing or two--of\\nearly salads, and those special apples the king loved to receive from him, mille-fleurs pippins, painted with\\na thousand tiny streaks of red, yellow, and green.  A dish of them came to table now, with a bottle, at the \\nright moment, from the darkest corner of the cellar.  And then, in nasal voice, well-trained to Latin \\nintonation, giving a quite medieval amplitude to the poet\\'s sonorities of rhythm and vocabulary, the \\nSub-prior was bidden to sing, after the notation of Goudimel, the \"Elegy of the Rose\"; the author girding \\ncheerily at the clerkly man\\'s assumed ignorance of such compositions.  \\nIt was but a half-gaiety, in truth, that awoke in the poet even now, with the singing and the good wine, as \\nthe notes echoed windily along the passages.  On his forty-sixth year the unaffected melancholy of his \\nlater life was already gathering.  The dead!--he was coming to be on their side.  The fact came home to \\nGaston that this evocator of \"the eternally youthful\" was visibly old before his time; his work being done, or\\ncentered now for the most part on amendments, not invariably happy, of his earlier verse.  The little \\npanelled drawers were full of them.  The poet pulled out one, and as it stood open for a moment there lay \\nthe first book of the Franciade, in silken cover, white and gold, ready for the king\\'s hands, but never to be \\nfinished.  \\nGaston, as he turned from that stolen reading of the opening verse in jerky, feverish, gouty manuscript, to \\nthe writer, let out his soul perhaps; for the poet\\'s face struck fire too, and seeming to detect on a sudden \\nthe legible document of something by no means conventional below the young man\\'s well-controlled \\nmanner and expression, he became as if paternally anxious for his intellectual furtherance, and in \\nparticular for the addition of \"manly power\" to a \"grace\" of mind, obviously there already in due sufficiency.\\n Would he presently carry a letter with recommendation of himself to Monsieur Michel de Montaigne?  \\nLinked they were, in the common friendship of the late Etienne de la Boetie yonder!  Monsieur Michel \\ncould tell him much of the great ones--of the Greek and Latin masters of style.  Let his study be in them!  \\nWith what justice, by the way, had those Latin poets dealt with winter, and wintry charms, in their bland \\nItaly!  And just then, at the striking of a rickety great bell of the Middle Age, in the hands of a cowled \\nbrother came the emblazoned grace-cup, with which the Prior de Ronsard had enriched his \"house,\" and \\nthe guests withdrew.  \\n\"Yesterday\\'s snow\" was nowhere, a surprising sunlight everywhere; through which, after gratefully bidding', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 17}),\n Document(page_content='adieu to the great poet, almost on their knees for a blessing, our adventurers returned home.  Gaston, \\nintently pondering as he lingered behind the others, was aware that this new poetry, which seemed to \\nhave transformed his whole nature into half-sensuous imagination, was the product not of one or more \\nindividual writers, but (it might be in the way of a response to their challenge) a general direction of men\\'s \\nminds, a delightful \"fashion\" of the time.  He almost anticipated our modern idea, or platitude, of the \\nZeit-geist.  A social instinct was involved in the matter, and loyalty to an intellectual movement.  As its \\nleader had himself been the first to suggest, the actual authorship belonged not so much to a star as to a \\nconstellation, like that hazy Pleiad he had pointed out in the sky, or like the swarm of larks abroad this \\nmorning over the corn, led by a common instinct, a large element in which was sympathetic trust in the \\ninstinct of others.  Here, truly, was a doctrine to propagate, a secret open to every one who would learn, \\ntowards a new management of life,--nay! a new religion, or at least a new worship, maintaining and visibly\\nsetting forth a single overpowering apprehension.  \\nThe worship of physical beauty a religion, the proper faculty of which would be the bodily eye!  Looked at \\nin this way, some of the well- marked characteristics of the poetry of the Pleiad assumed a hieratic, \\nalmost an ecclesiastical air.  That rigid correctness; that gracious unction, as of the medieval Latin \\npsalmody; that aspiring fervour; that jealousy of the profane \"vulgar\"; the sense, flattering to one who was \\nin the secret, that this thing, even in its utmost triumph, could never be really popular:--why were these so \\nwelcome to him but from the continuity of early mental habit?  He might renew the over-grown tonsure, \\nand wait, devoutly, rapturously, in this goodly sanctuary of earth and sky about him, for the manifestation, \\nat the moment of his own worthiness, of flawless humanity, in some undreamed-of depth and perfection of\\nthe loveliness of bodily form.  \\nAnd therewith came the consciousness, no longer of mere bad- neighbourship between what was old and\\nnew in his life, but of incompatibility between two rival claimants upon him, of two ideals. Might that new \\nreligion be a religion not altogether of goodness, a profane religion, in spite of its poetic fervours?  There \\nwere \"flowers of evil,\" among the rest.  It came in part, avowedly, as a kind of consecration of evil, and \\nseemed to give it the beauty of holiness.  Rather, good and evil were distinctions inapplicable in \\nproportion as these new interests made themselves felt.  For a moment, amid casuistical questions as to \\none\\'s indefeasible right to liberty of heart, he saw himself, somewhat wearily, very far gone from the \\nchoice, the consecration, of his boyhood.  If he could but be rid of that altogether!  Or if that would but \\nspeak with irresistible decision and effect!  Was there perhaps somewhere, in some penetrative mind in \\nthis age of novelties, some scheme of truth, some science about men and things, which might harmonise \\nfor him his earlier and later preference, \"the sacred and the profane loves,\" or, failing that, establish, to his\\npacification, the exclusive supremacy of the latter?  \\n  \\nCHAPTER IV.  PEACH-BLOSSOM AND WINE  \\n  \\nThose searchings of mind brought from time to time cruel starts from sleep, a sudden shudder at any wide\\noutlook over life and its issues, draughts of mental east-wind across the hot mornings, into which the \\nvoices of his companions called him, to lose again in long rambles every thought save that of his own \\nfirm, abounding youth. These rambles were but the last, sweet, wastefully-spent remnants of a happy \\nseason.  The letter for Monsieur Michel de Montaigne was to hand, with preparations for the distant \\njourney which must presently break up their comradeship.  Nevertheless, its actual termination overtook \\nthem at the last as if by surprise: on a sudden that careless interval of time was over.  \\nThe carelessness of \"the three\" at all events had been entire. Secure, on the low, warm, level surface of \\nthings, they talked, they, rode, they ate and drank, with no misgivings, mental or moral, no too curious \\nquestions as to the essential nature of their so palpable well-being, or the rival standards thereof, of \\norigins and issues.  And yet, with all their gaiety, as its last triumphant note in truth, they were ready to \\ntrifle with death, welcoming, by way of a foil to the easy character of their days, a certain luxurious sense \\nof danger--the night-alarm, the arquebuse peeping from some quiet farm-building across their way, the \\nrumoured presence in their neighbourhood of this or that great military leader--delightful premonitions of \\nthe adventurous life soon to be their own in Paris. What surmises they had of any vaguer sort of danger, \\ntook effect, in that age of wizardry, as a quaintly practical superstition, the expectation of cadaverous \\n\"churchyard things\" and the like, intruding themselves where they should not be, to be dissipated in turn \\nby counter-devices of the dark craft which had evoked them.  Gaston, then, as in after years, though he \\nsaw no ghosts, could not bear to trifle with such matters: to his companions it was a delight, as they ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 18}),\n Document(page_content='supped, to note the indication of nameless terrors, if it were only in the starts and crackings of the timbers \\nof the old place.  To the turbid spirits of that generation the midnight heaven itself was by no means a \\nrestful companion; and many were the hours wasted by those young astrophiles in puzzling out the \\nthreats, or the enigmatic promises, of a starry sky.  \\nThe fact that armed persons were still abroad, thieves or assassins, lurking under many disguises, might \\nexplain what happened on the last evening of their time together, when they sat late at the open windows \\nas the night increased, serene but covered summer night, aromatic, velvet-footed.  What coolness it had \\nwas pleasant after the wine; and they strolled out, fantastically muffled in certain old heraldic dresses of \\nparade, caught up in the hall as they passed through, Gaston alone remaining to attend on his \\ngrandfather.  In about an hour\\'s time they returned, not a little disconcerted, to tell a story of which Gaston\\nwas reminded (seeing them again in thought as if only half real, amid the bloomy night, with blood upon \\ntheir boyish flowers) as they crossed his path afterwards at three intervals.  Listening for the night-hawk, \\npushing aside the hedge-row to catch the evening breath of the honeysuckle, they had sauntered on, \\nscarcely looking in advance, along the causeway.  Soft sounds came out of the distance, but footsteps on \\nthe hard road they had not heard, when three others fronted them face to face--Jasmin, Amadée, and \\nCamille--their very selves, visible in the light of the lantern carried by Camille: they might have felt the \\nbreath upon their cheeks: real, close, definite, cap for cap, plume for plume, flower for flower, a light like \\ntheir own flashed up counter-wise, but with blood, all three of them, fresh upon the bosom, or in the \\nmouth.  It was well to draw the sword, be one\\'s enemy carnal or spiritual; even devils, as wise men know, \\ntaking flight at its white glitter through the air.  Out flashed the brave youths\\' swords, still with mimic \\ncounter-motion, upon nothing--upon the empty darkness before them.  \\nCurdled at heart for an hour by that strange encounter, they went on their way next morning no different.  \\nThere was something in the mere belief that peace was come at last.  For a moment Huguenots were, or \\npretended to be, satisfied with a large concession of liberty; to be almost light of soul.  The French, who \\ncan always pause in the very midst of civil bloodshed to eulogise the reign of universal kindness, were \\ndetermined to treat a mere armistice as nothing less than realised Utopia.  To bear offensive weapons \\nbecame a crime; and the sense of security at home was attested by vague schemes of glory to be won \\nabroad, under the leadership of \"The Admiral,\" the great Huguenot Coligni, anxious to atone for his share \\nin the unhappiness of France by helping her to foreign conquests.  Philip of Spain had been watching for \\nthe moment when Charles and Catherine should call the Duke of Alva into France to continue his devout \\nwork there. Instead, the poetic mind of Charles was dazzled for a moment by the dream of wrestling the \\nmisused Netherlands from Spanish rule altogether.  \\nUnder such genial conditions, then, Gaston set out towards those south-west regions he had always \\nyearned to, as popular imagination just now set thither also, in a vision of French ships going forth from \\nthe mouths of the Loire and the Gironde, from Nantes, Bordeaux, and La Rochelle, to the Indies, in rivalry \\nof Spanish adventure.  The spasmodic gaiety of the time blent with that of the season of the year, of his \\nown privileged time of life, and allowed the opulent country through which he was to pass all its \\nadvantages.  Ever afterwards that low ring of blue hills beyond La Beauce meant more for him, not less, \\nthan of old.  After the reign of his native apple-blossom and corn, it was that of peach-blossom and wine.  \\nSouthwards to Orleans and the Loire then, with the course of the sunny river, to Blois, to Amboise, to \\nTours, he traversed a region of unquestioned natural charm, heightened greatly by the mental \\natmosphere through which it reached him.  Black Angers, white Saumur, with its double in the calm broad \\nwater below, the melancholy seigneurial woods of Blois, ranged themselves in his memory as so many \\ndistinct types of what was dignified or pleasant in human habitations.  Frequently, along the great historic \\nstream, as along some vast street, contemporary genius was visible (a little prematurely as time would \\nshow) in a novel and seductive architecture, which, by its engrafting of exotic grace on homely native \\nforms, spoke of a certain restless aspiration to be what one was not but might become--the old Gaulish \\ndesire to be refined, to be mentally enfranchised by the sprightlier genius of Italy.  With their terraced \\ngardens, their airy galleries, their triumphal chimney-pieces, their spacious stairways, their conscious \\nprovision for the elegant enjoyment of all seasons in turn, here surely were the new abodes for the new \\nhumanity of this new, poetic, picturesque age.  What but flawless bodies, duly appointed to typically \\ndeveloped souls, could move on the daily business of life through these dreamy apartments into which he \\nentered from time to time, finding their very garniture like a personal presence in them?  Was there light \\nhere in the earth itself?  It was a landscape, certainly, which did not merely accept the sun, but flashed it \\nback gratefully from the white, gracious, carven houses, that were like a natural part of it. As he passed ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 19}),\n Document(page_content='below, fancy would sometimes credit the outlook from their lofty gables with felicities of combination \\nbeyond possibility. What prospects of mountain and sea-shore from those aerial window- seats!  \\nAnd still, as in some sumptuous tapestry, the architecture, the landscape, were but a setting for the \\nhuman figures: these palatial abodes, never out of sight, high on the river bank, challenged continual \\nspeculation as to their inhabitants--how they moved, read poetry and romance, or wrote the memoirs \\nwhich were like romance, passed through all the hourly changes of their all- accomplished, intimate life.  \\nThe Loire was the river pre-eminently of the monarchy, of the court; and the fleeting human interests, fact \\nor fancy, which gave its utmost value to the liveliness of the natural scene, found a centre in the \\nmovements of Catherine and her sons, still roving, after the eccentric habit inherited from Francis the \\nFirst, from one \"house of pleasure\" to another, in the pursuit at once of amusement and of that political \\nintrigue which was the serious business of their lives.  Like some fantastic company of strolling players \\namid the hushed excitement of a little town, the royal family, with all its own small rivalries, would be \\nhoused for the night under the same roof with some of its greater enemies--Henri de Guise, Condé, \"The \\nAdmiral,\" all alike taken by surprise--but courteously, and therefore ineffectively.  And Gaston, come thus \\nby chance so close to them, had the sense not so much of nearness to the springs of great events, as of \\nthe likeness of the whole matter to a stage-play with its ingeniously contrived encounters, or the \\nassortments of a game of chance.  \\nAnd in a while the dominant course of the river itself, the animation of its steady, downward flow, even \\namid the sand-shoals and whispering islets of the dry season, bore his thoughts beyond it, in a sudden \\nirresistible appetite for the sea; and he determined, varying slightly from the prescribed route, to reach his \\ndestination by way of the coast.  From Nantes he descended imperceptibly along tall hedge-rows of \\nacacia, till on a sudden, with a novel freshness in the air, through a low archway of laden fruit-trees it was \\nvisible--sand, sea, and sky, in three quiet spaces, line upon line.  The features of the landscape changed \\nagain, and the gardens, the rich orchards, gave way to bare, grassy undulations: only, the open sandy \\nspaces presented their own native flora, for the fine silex seemed to have crept into the tall, wiry stalks of \\nthe ixias, like grasses the seeds of which had expanded, by solar magic, into veritable flowers, crimson, \\ngreen, or yellow patched with black.  \\nIt was pleasant to sleep as if in the sea\\'s arms, amid the low murmurs, the salt odour mingled with the \\nwild garden scents of a little inn or farm, forlorn in the wide enclosure of an ancient manor, deserted as \\nthe sea encroached--long ago, for the fig-trees in the riven walls were tough and old.  Next morning he \\nmust turn his back betimes, with the freshness of the outlook still undimmed, all colours turning to white \\non the shell-beach, the wrecks, the children at play on it, the boat with its gay streamers dancing in the \\nfoam. Bright as the scene of his journey had been, it had had from time to time its grisly touches; a \\nforbidden fortress with its steel-clad inmates thrust itself upon the way; the village church had been ruined\\ntoo recently to count as picturesque; and at last, at the meeting-point of five long causeways across a \\nwide expanse of marshland, where the wholesome sea turned stagnant, La Rochelle itself scowled \\nthrough the heavy air, the dark ramparts still rising higher around its dark townsfolk:--La Rochelle, the \\n\"Bastion of the Gospel\" according to John Calvin, the conceded capital of the Huguenots.  They were \\nthere, and would not leave it, even to share the festivities of the marriage of King Charles to his little \\nAustrian Elizabeth about this time--the armed chiefs of Protestantism, dreaming of a \"dictator\" after the \\nRoman manner, who should set up a religious republic.  Serried closely together on land, they had a \\nstrange mixed following on the sea.  Lair of heretics, or shelter of martyrs, La Rochelle was ready to \\nprotect the outlaw.  The corsair, of course, would be a Protestant, actually armed perhaps by sour old \\nJeanne of Navarre--the ship he fell across, of course, Spanish.  A real Spanish ship of war, gay, \\nmagnificent, was gliding even then, stealthily, through the distant haze; and nearer lay what there was of \\na French navy.  Did the enigmatic \"Admiral,\" the coming dictator, Coligni, really wish to turn it to foreign \\nadventure, in rivalry of Spain, as the proper patriotic outcome of this period, or breathing-space, of peace \\nand national unity?  \\nUndoubtedly they were still there, even in this halcyon weather, those causes of disquiet, like the volcanic \\nforces beneath the massive chestnut-woods, spread so calmly through the breathless air, on the ledges \\nand levels of the red heights of the Limousin, under which Gaston now passed on his way southwards.  \\nOn his right hand a broad, lightly diversified expanse of vineyard, of towns and towers innumerable, rolled\\nits burden of fat things down the slope of the Gironde towards the more perfect level beyond.  In the \\nheady afternoon an indescribable softness laid hold on him, from the objects, the atmosphere, the lazy \\nbusiness, of the scene around.  And was that the quarter whence the dry daylight, the intellectual iron, the', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 20}),\n Document(page_content='chalybeate influence, was to come?--those coquettish, well-kept, vine-wreathed towers, smiling over a \\nlittle irregular old village, itself half-hidden in gadding vine, pointed out by the gardeners (all labourers \\nhere were gardeners) as the end of his long, pleasant journey, as the abode of Monsieur Michel de \\nMontaigne, the singular but not unpopular gentleman living there among his books, of whom Gaston \\nhears so much over-night at the inn where he rests, before delivering the great poet\\'s letter, entering his \\nroom at last in a flutter of curiosity.  \\nIn those earlier days of the Renaissance, a whole generation had been exactly in the position in which \\nGaston now found himself.  An older ideal moral and religious, certain theories of man and nature actually\\nin possession, still haunted humanity, at the very moment when it was called, through a full knowledge of \\nthe past, to enjoy the present with an unrestricted expansion of its own capacities.--Might one enjoy?  \\nMight one eat of all the trees?--Some had already eaten, and needed, retrospectively, a theoretic \\njustification, a sanction of their actual liberties, in some new reading of human nature itself and its relation \\nto the world around it.--Explain to us the propriety, on the full view of things, of this bold course we have \\ntaken, or know we shall take!  \\nEx post facto, at all events, that justification was furnished by the Essays of Montaigne.  The spirit of the \\nessays doubtless had been felt already in many a mind, as, by a universal law of reaction, the intellect \\ndoes supply the due theoretic equivalent to an inevitable course of conduct.  But it was Montaigne \\ncertainly who turned that emancipating ethic into current coin.  To Pascal, looking back upon the sixteenth\\ncentury as a whole, Montaigne was to figure as the impersonation of its intellectual licence; while \\nShakespeare, who represents the free spirit of the Renaissance moulding the drama, hints, by his \\nwell-known preoccupation with Montaigne\\'s writings, that just there was the philosophic counterpart to the\\nfulness and impartiality of his own artistic reception of the experience of life.  \\nThose essays, as happens with epoch-marking books, were themselves a life, the power which makes \\nthem what they are having been accumulated in them imperceptibly by a thousand repeated \\nmodifications, like character in a person: at the moment when Gaston presented himself, to go along with \\nthe great \"egotist\" for a season, that life had just begun.  Born here, at the place whose name he took, \\nMontaigne--the acclivity--of Saint Michael, just thirty-six years before, brought up simply, earthily, at nurse\\nin one of the neighbouring villages, to him it was doubled strength to return thither, when, disgusted with \\nthe legal business which had filled his days hitherto, seeing that \"France had more laws than all the rest \\nof the world,\" and was what one saw, he began the true work of his life, a continual journey in thought, \"a \\ncontinual observation of new and unknown things,\" his bodily self remaining, for the most part, with \\nseeming indolence at home.  \\nIt was Montaigne\\'s boast that throughout those invasive times his house had lain open to all comers, that \\nhis frankness had been rewarded by immunity from all outrages of war, of the crime war shelters: and \\nopenness--that all was wide open, searched through by light and warmth and air from the soil--was the \\nimpression it made on Gaston, as he passed from farmyard to garden, from garden to court, to hall, up \\nthe wide winding stair, to the uppermost chamber of the great round tower; in which sun-baked place the \\nstudious man still lingered over a late breakfast, telling, like all around, of a certain homely epicureanism, \\na rare mixture of luxury with a preference for the luxuries that after all were home-grown and savoured of \\nhis native earth.  \\nSociable, of sociable intellect, and still inclining instinctively, as became his fresh and agreeable person, \\nfrom the midway of life, towards its youthful side, he was ever on the alert for a likely interlocutor to take \\npart in the conversation, which (pleasantest, truly! of all modes of human commerce) was also of ulterior \\nservice as stimulating that endless inward converse from which the essays were a kind of abstract.  For \\nhim, as for Plato, for Socrates whom he cites so often, the essential dialogue was that of the mind with \\nitself; but this dialogue throve best with, often actually needed, outward stimulus--physical motion, some \\ntext shot from a book, the queries and objections of a living voice.--\"My thoughts sleep, if I sit still.\"  \\nNeither \"thoughts,\" nor \"dialogues,\" exclusively, but thoughts still partly implicate in the dialogues which \\nhad evoked them, and therefore not without many seemingly arbitrary transitions, many links of connexion\\nto be supposed by the reader, constituting their characteristic difficulty, the Essays owed their actual \\npublication at last to none of the usual literary motives--desire for fame, to instruct, to amuse, to sell--but \\nto the sociable desire for a still wider range of conversation with others.  He wrote for companionship, \"if \\nbut one sincere man would make his acquaintance\"; speaking on paper, as he \"did to the first person he \\nmet.\"--\"If there be any person, any knot of good company, in France or elsewhere, who can like my \\nhumour, and whose humours I can like, let them but whistle, and I will run!\"  ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 21}),\n Document(page_content='Notes of expressive facts, of words also worthy of note (for he was a lover of style), collected in the first \\ninstance for the help of an irregular memory, were becoming, in the quaintly labelled drawers, with labels \\nof wise old maxim or device, the primary, rude stuff, or \"protoplasm,\" of his intended work, and already \\ngave token of its scope and variety.  \"All motion discovers us\"; if to others, so also to ourselves.  \\nMovement, rapid movement of some kind, a ride, the hasty survey of a shelf of books, best of all a \\nconversation like this morning\\'s with a visitor for the first time,--amid the felicitous chances of that, at \\nsome random turn by the way, he would become aware of shaping purpose: the beam of light or heat \\nwould strike down, to illuminate, to fuse and organise the coldly accumulated matter, of reason, of \\nexperience.  Surely, some providence over thought and speech led one finely through those haphazard \\njourneys!  But thus dependent to so great a degree on external converse for the best fruit of his own \\nthought, he was also an efficient evocator of the thought of another--himself an original spirit more than \\ntolerating the originality of others,--which brought it into play.  Here was one who (through natural \\npredilection, reinforced by theory) would welcome one\\'s very self, undistressed by, while fully observant \\nof, its difference from his own--one\\'s errors, vanities, perhaps fatuities.  Naturally eloquent, expressive, \\nwith a mind like a rich collection of the choice things of all times and countries, he was at his best, his \\nhappiest, amid the magnetic contacts of an easy conversation.  When Gaston years afterwards came to \\nread the famous Essays, he found many a delightful actual conversation re-set, and had the key we lack \\nto their surprises, their capricious turns and lapses.--Well!  Montaigne had opened the letter, had forthwith\\npassed his genial criticism on the writer, and then, characteristically, forgetting all about it, turned to the \\nbearer as if he had been intimate with him from childhood. And the feeling was mutual.  Gaston in half an \\nhour seemed to have known his entertainer all his life.  \\nIn unimpeded talk with sincere persons of what quality soever--there, rather than in shadowy converse \\nwith even the best books--the flower, the fruit, of mind was still in life-giving contact with its root. With \\nbooks, as indeed with persons, his intercourse was apt to be desultory.  Books!--He was by way of \\nasserting his independence of them, was their very candid friend:--they were far from being  an unmixed \\ngood.  He would observe (the fact was its own scornful comment) that there were more books upon books\\nthan upon any other subject.  Yet books, more than a thousand volumes, a handsome library for that day, \\nnicely representative not only of literature but of the owner\\'s taste therein, lay all around; and turning now \\nto this, now to that, he handled their pages with nothing less than tenderness: it was the first of many \\ninconsistencies which yet had about them a singularly taking air, of reason, of equity.  Plutarch and \\nSeneca were soon in the foreground: they would \"still be at his elbow to test and be tested\": masters of \\nthe autumnal wisdom that was coming to be his own, ripe and placid--from the autumn of old Rome, of \\nlife, of the world, the very genius of second thoughts, of exquisite tact and discretion, of judgment upon \\nknowledge.  \\nBut the books dropped from his hands in the very midst of enthusiastic quotation; and the guest was \\nmounting a little turret staircase, was on the leaden roof of the old tower, amid the fat, noonday Gascon \\nscenery.  He saw, in bird\\'s-eye view, the country he was soon to become closely acquainted with, a \\ncountry (like its people) of passion and capacity, though at that moment emphatically lazy.  Towards the \\nend of life some conscientious pangs seem to have touched Montaigne\\'s singularly humane and sensitive\\nspirit, when he looked back on the long intellectual entertainment he had had, in following, as an inactive \\nspectator, \"the ruin of his country,\" through a series of chapters, every one of which had told emphatically \\nin his own immediate neighbourhood.  With its old and new battlefields, its business, its fierce changes, \\nand the old perennial sameness of men\\'s ways beneath them all, it had been certainly matter of more \\nassiduous reading than even those choice, incommensurable, books, of ancient Greek and Roman \\nexperience.  The variableness, the complexity, the miraculous surprises of man, concurrent with the \\nvariety, the complexity, the surprises of nature, making all true knowledge of either wholly relative and \\nprovisional; a like insecurity in one\\'s self, if one turned thither for some ray of clear and certain evidence; \\nthis, with an equally strong sense all the time of the interest, the power and charm, alike of man and \\nnature and of the individual mind;--such was the sense of this open book, of all books and things.  That \\nwas what this quietly enthusiastic reader was ready to assert as the sum of his studies; disturbingly, as \\nGaston found, reflecting on his long unsuspicious sojourn there, and detaching from the habits, the \\nrandom traits of character, his concessions and hints and sudden emphatic statements, the soul and \\npotency of the man.  \\nHow imperceptibly had darkness crept over them, effacing everything but the interior of the great circular \\nchamber, its book-shelves and enigmatic mottoes and the tapestry on the wall,--Circe and her sorceries, ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 22}),\n Document(page_content='in many parts--to draw over the windows in winter.  Supper over, the young wife entered at last.  Always \\non the lookout for the sincerities of human nature (sincerity counting for life-giving form, whatever the \\nmatter might be) as he delighted in watching children, Montaigne loved also to watch grown people when \\nthey were most like children; at their games, therefore, and in the mechanical and customary parts of their\\nexistence, as discovering the real soul in them.  Abstaining from the dice himself, since for him such \"play \\nwas not play enough, but too grave and serious a diversion,\" and remarking that \"the play of children is \\nnot performed in play, but to be judged as their most serious action,\" he set Gaston and the amiable, \\nunpedantic, lady to play together, where he might observe them closely; the game turning still, irresistibly, \\nto conversation, the last and sweetest if somewhat drowsy relics of this long day\\'s recreations.--Was \\nCirce\\'s castle here?  If Circe could turn men into swine, could she also release them again?  It was frailty, \\ncertainly, that Gaston remained here week after week, scarce knowing why; the conversation begun that \\nmorning lasting for nine months, over books, meals, in free rambles chiefly on horseback, as if in the \\nwaking intervals of a long day-sleep.  \\n  \\nCHAPTER V.  SUSPENDED JUDGMENT  \\n  \\nThe diversity, the undulancy, of human nature!--so deep a sense of it went with Montaigne always that \\nhimself too seemed to be ever changing colour sympathetically therewith.  Those innumerable \\ndifferences, mental and physical, of which men had always been aware, on which they had so largely fed \\ntheir vanity, were ultimate.  That the surface of humanity presented an infinite variety was the tritest of \\nfacts.  Pursue that variety below the surface!--the lines did but part further and further asunder, with an \\never-increasing divergency, which made any common measure of truth impossible.  Diversity of \\ncustom!--What was it but diversity in the moral and mental view, diversity of opinion? and diversity of \\nopinion, what but radical diversity of mental constitution?  How various in kind and degree had he found \\nmen\\'s thoughts concerning death, for instance, \"some (ah me!) even running headlong upon it, with a real\\naffection\"? Death, life; wealth, poverty; the whole sum of contrasts; nay! duty itself,--the relish of right and \\nwrong\"; all depend upon the opinion each one has of them, and \"receive no colour of good or evil but \\naccording to the application of the individual soul.\"  Did Hamlet learn of him that \"there is nothing either \\ngood or bad but thinking makes it so\"?--What we call evil is not so of itself: it depends only upon us, to \\ngive it another taste and complexion.--Things, in respect of themselves, have peradventure their weight, \\nmeasure, and conditions; but when once we have taken them into us, the soul forms them as she \\npleases.--Death is terrible to Cicero, courted by Cato, indifferent to Socrates.--Fortune, circumstance, \\noffers but the matter: \\'tis the soul adds the form.--Every opinion, how fantastic soever to some, is to \\nanother of force enough to be espoused at the risk of life.\"  \\nFor opinion was the projection of individual will, of a native original predilection.  Opinions!--they are like \\nthe clothes we wear, which warm us, not with their heat, but with ours.  Track your way (as he had \\nlearned to do) to the remote origin of what looks like folly; at home, on its native soil, it was found to be \\njustifiable, as a proper growth of wisdom.  In the vast conflict of taste, preference, conviction, there was no\\nreal inconsistency.  It was but that the soul looked \"upon things with another eye, and represented them \\nto itself with another kind of face; reason being a tincture almost equally infused into all our manners and \\nopinions; though there never were in the world two opinions exactly alike.\" And the practical comment \\nwas, not as one might have expected, towards the determination of some common standard of truth amid \\nthat infinite variety, but to this effect rather, that we are not bound to receive every opinion we are not able\\nto refute, nor to accept another\\'s refutation of our own; these diversities being themselves ultimate, and \\nthe priceless pearl of truth lying, if anywhere, not in large theoretic apprehension of the general, but in \\nminute vision of the particular; in the perception of the concrete phenomenon, at this particular moment, \\nand from this unique point of view--that for you, this for me--now, but perhaps not then.  \\nNow; and not then!  For if men are so diverse, not less disparate are the many men who keep discordant \\ncompany within each one of us, \"every man carrying in him the entire form of human condition.\" \"That we \\ntaste nothing pure:\" the variancy of the individual in regard to himself: the complexity of soul which there, \\ntoo, makes \"all judgments in the gross\" impossible or useless, certainly inequitable, he delighted to note.  \\nMen\\'s minds were like the grotesques which some artists of that day loved to joint together, or like one of \\nhis own inconstant essays, never true for a page to its proposed subject.  \"Nothing is so supple as our \\nunderstanding: it is double and diverse; and the matters are double and diverse, too.\"  \\nHere, as it seemed to Gaston, was one for whom exceptions had taken the place of law: the very genius ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n Document(page_content='of qualification followed him through all his keen, constant, changeful consideration of men and things.  \\nHow many curious moral variations he had to show!--\"vices that are lawful\": vices in us which \"help to \\nmake up the seam in our piecing, as poisons are useful for the conservation of health\": \"actions good and \\nexcusable that are not lawful in themselves\": \"the soul discharging her passions upon false objects where \\nthe true are wanting\": men doing more than they propose, or they hardly know what, at immense hazard, \\nor pushed to do well by vice itself, or working for their enemies: \"condemnations more criminal than the \\ncrimes they condemn\": the excuses that are self-accusations: instances, from his own experience, of a \\nhasty confidence in other men\\'s virtue which \"God had favoured\": and how, \"even to the worst people, it is\\nsweet, their end once gained by a vicious act, to foist into it some show of justice.\"  In the presence of this\\nindefatigable analyst of act and motive all fixed outlines seemed to vanish away.  The healthful pleasure \\nof motion, of thoughts in motion!--Yes! Gaston felt them, the oldest of them, moving, as he listened, under\\nand away from his feet, as if with the ground he stood on.  And this was the vein of thought which oftenest\\nled the master back contemptuously to emphasise the littleness of man.--\"I think we can never be \\ndespised according to our full desert.\"  \\nBy way of counterpoise, there were admirable surprises in man.  That cross-play of human tendencies \\ndetermined from time to time in the forces of unique and irresistible character, \"moving all together,\" \\npushing the world around it to phenomenal good or evil.  For such as \"make it their business to oversee \\nhuman actions, it seems impossible they should proceed from one and the same person.\"  Consolidation \\nof qualities supposed, this did but make character, already the most attractive, because the most \\ndynamic, phenomenon of experience, more interesting still.  So tranquil a spectator of so average a world,\\na too critical minimiser, it might seem, of all that pretends to be of importance, Montaigne was constantly, \\ngratefully, announcing his contact, in life, in books, with undeniable power and greatness, with forces full \\nof beauty in their vigour, like lightning, the sea, the torrents:--overpowering desire augmented, yet \\nvictorious, by its very difficulty; the bewildering constancy of martyrs; single-hearted virtue not to be \\nresolved into anything less surprising than itself; the devotion of that famed, so companionable, wife, \\ndying cheerfully by her own act along with the sick husband \"who could do no better than kill himself\"; the \\ngrief, the joy, of which men suddenly die; the unconscious Stoicism of the poor; that stern self-control with\\nwhich Jacques Bonhomme goes as usual to his daily labour with a heart tragic for the dead child at home;\\nnay! even the boldness and strength of \"those citizens who sacrifice honour and conscience, as others of \\nold sacrificed their lives, for the good of their country.\" So carefully equable, his mind nevertheless was \\nstored with, and delighted in, incidents, personalities, of barbarous strength--Esau, in all his phases--the \\nvery rudest children or \"our great and powerful mother, nature.\"  As Plato had said, \"\\'twas to no purpose \\nfor a sober-minded man to knock at the door of poesy,\" or, if truth were spoken, of any other high matter \\nof doing or making.  That was consistent with his sympathetic belief in the capability of mere impetuous \\nyouth as such.  Even those unexpected traits in ordinary people which seem to hint at larger laws and \\ndeeper forces of character, disconcerting any narrow judgment upon them, he welcomed as akin to his \\nown indolent, but suddenly kindling, nature:--the mere self-will of men, the shrewd wisdom of an \\nunlettered old woman, the fount of goodness in a cold or malicious heart.  \"I hear every day fools say \\nthings far from foolish.\"  Those invincible prepossessions of humanity, or of the individual, which Bacon \\nreckoned \"idols of the cave,\" are no offence to him; are direct informations, it may be, beyond price, from \\na kindly spirit of truth in things.  \\nFor him there had been two grand surprises, two pre-eminent manifestations of the power and charm of \\nman, not to be explained away,--one, within the compass of general and public observation: the other, a \\nmatter of special intimacy to himself.  There had been the greatness of the old Greek and Roman life, so \\ngreatly recorded: there had been the wisdom and kindness of Etienne de la Boetie, as made known in all \\ntheir fulness to him alone.  That his ardent devotion to the ancients had been rewarded with minute \\nknowledge concerning them, was the privilege of the age in which he was born, late in the Revival of \\nLetters.  But the classical reading, which with others was often but an affectation, seducing them from the \\nhighest to a lower degree of reality, from men and women to their mere shadows in old books, had been \\nfor him nothing less than personal contact.  \"The qualities and fortunes\" of the old Romans, especially, \\ntheir wonderful straight ways through the world, the straight passage of their armies upon them, the \\nsplendour of their armour, of their entire external presence and show, their \"riches and embellishments,\" \\nabove all, \"the suddenness of Augustus,\" in that grander age for which decision was justifiable because \\nreally possible, had ever been \"more in his head than the fortunes of his own country.\"  If \"we have no \\nhold even on things present but by imagination,\" as he loved to observe,--then, how much more potent, ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 24}),\n Document(page_content='steadier, larger, the imaginative substance of the world of Alexander and Socrates, of Virgil and Caesar, \\nthan that of an age, which seemed to him, living in the midst of it, respectable mainly by its docility, by an \\nimitation of the ancients which after all left untouched the real sources of their greatness.  They had been \\nindeed great, at the least dramatically, redeemed in part by magnificent courage and tact, in their very \\nsins.  \"Our force is no more able to reach them in their vicious than in their virtuous qualities; for both the \\none and the other proceed from a vigour of soul which was without comparison greater in them than in \\nus.\"  \\nAnd yet, thinking of his friendship with the \"incomparable Etienne de la Boetie, so perfect, inviolate and \\nentire, that the like is hardly to be found in story,\" he had to confess that the sources of greatness must \\nstill be quick in the world.  That had remained with him as his one fixed standard of value in the estimate \\nof men and things.  On this single point, antiquity itself had been surpassed; the discourses it had left \\nupon friendship seeming to him \"poor and flat in comparison of the sense he had of it.\"  For once, his \\nsleepless habit of analysis had been checked by the inexplicable, the absolute; amid his jealously \\nguarded indifference of soul he had been summoned to yield, and had yielded, to the magnetic power of \\nanother.  \"We were halves throughout, so that methinks by outliving him I defraud him of his part.  I was \\nso grown to be always his double in all things that methinks I am no more than half of myself. There is no \\naction or thought of mine wherein I do not miss him, as I know that he would have missed me.\"  Tender \\nyet heroic, impulsive yet so wise, he might have done what the survivor (so it seemed to himself) was but \\nvainly trying to do.  It was worth his while to become famous, if that hapless memory might but be \\nembalmed in one\\'s fame.  It had been better than love,--that friendship! to the building of which so much \\n\"concurrence\" had been requisite, that \"\\'twas much if fortune brought the like to pass once in three ages.\" \\nActually, we may think, the \"sweet society\" of those four years, in comparison with which the rest of his so\\npleasant life \"was but smoke,\" had touched Montaigne\\'s nature with refinements it might otherwise have \\nlacked.  He would have wished \"to speak concerning it, to those who had experience\" of what he said, \\ncould such have been found.  In despair of that, he loved to discourse of it to all comers,--how it had come\\nabout, the circumstances of its sudden and wonderful growth.  Yet after all were he pressed to say why he\\nhad so loved Etienne de la Boetie, he could but answer, \"Because it was He!  Because it was I!\"  \\nAnd the surprises there are in man, his complexity, his variancy, were symptomatic of the changefulness, \\nthe confusion, the surprises, of the earth under one\\'s feet, of the whole material world.  The irregular, the \\nunforeseen, the inconsecutive, miracle, accident, he noted lovingly: it had a philosophic import.  It was \\nhabit rather than knowledge of them that took away the strangeness of the things actually about one.  \\nHow many unlikely matters there were, testified by persons worthy of faith, \"which, if we cannot persuade \\nourselves to believe, we ought at least to leave in suspense.--Though all that had arrived by report of past\\ntime should be true, it would be less than nothing in comparison of what is unknown.\"  \\nOn all sides we are beset by the incalculable--walled up suddenly, as if by malign trickery, in the open \\nfield, or pushed forward senselessly, by the crowd around us, to good-fortune.  In art, as in poetry, there \\nare the \"transports\" which lift the artist out of, as they are not of, himself; for orators also, \"those \\nextraordinary motions which sometimes carry them above their design.\"  Himself, \"in the necessity and \\nheat of combat,\" had sometimes made answers, that went \"through and through,\" beyond hope.  The \\nwork, by its own force and fortune, sometimes outstrips the workman.  And then, in defiance of the \\nproprieties, whereas poets sometimes \"flag, and languish in a prosaic manner,\" prose will shine with the \\nlustre, vigour and boldness, with \"the fury\" of poetry.  \\nAnd as to \"affairs,\"--how spasmodic the mixture, collision or coincidence, of the mechanic succession of \\nthings with men\\'s volition!  Mere rumour, so large a factor in events,--who could trace out its ways?  \\nVarious events (he was never tired of illustrating the fact) \"followed from the same counsel.\"  Fortune, \\nchance, that is to say, the incalculable contribution of mere matter to man, \"would still be mistress of \\nevents\"; and one might think it no un-wisdom to commit everything to fortuity.  But no! \"fortune too is \\noft-times observed to act by the rule of reason: chance itself comes round to hold of justice;\" war, above \\nall, being a matter in which fortune was inexplicable, though men might seem to have made it the main \\nbusiness of their lives.  If \"the force of all counsel lies in the occasion,\" that is because things perpetually \\nshift.  If man--his taste, his very conscience--change with the habit of time and place, that is because habit\\nis the emphatic determination, the tyranny, of changing external and material circumstance.  So it comes \\nabout that every one gives the name of barbarism to what is not in use round about him, excepting \\nperhaps the Greeks and Romans, somewhat conventionally; and Montaigne was fond of assuring people,\\nsuddenly, that could we have those privileged Greeks and Romans actually to sit beside us for a while, ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 25}),\n Document(page_content='they would be found to offend our niceties at a hundred points.  We have great power of taking ourselves \\nin, and \"pay ourselves with words.\"  Words too, language itself, and therewith the more intimate \\nphysiognomy of thought, \"slip every day through our fingers.\"  With his eye on his own labour, wistfully, he\\nthought on the instability of the French language in particular--a matter, after all, so much less \"perennial \\nthan brass.\"  In no respect was nature more stable, more consecutive, than man.  \\nIn nature, indeed, as in one\\'s self, there might be no ultimate inconsequence: only, \"the soul looks upon \\nthings with another eye, and represents them to itself with another kind of face: for everything has many \\nfaces and several aspects.  There is nothing single and rare in respect of itself, but only in respect of our \\nknowledge, which is a wretched foundation whereon to ground our rules, and one that represents to us a \\nvery false image of things.\" Ah! even in so \"dear\" a matter as bodily health, immunity from physical pain, \\nwhat doubts! what variations of experience, of learned opinion!  Already, in six years of married life, of \\nfour children treated so carefully, never, for instance, roughly awaked from sleep, \"wherein,\" he would \\nobserve, \"children are much more profoundly involved than we,\"--of four children, two were dead, and one\\neven now miserably sick.  Seeing the doctor depart one morning a little hastily, on the payment of his fee, \\nhe was tempted to some nice questions as to the money\\'s worth.  \"There are so many maladies, and so \\nmany circumstances, presented to the physician, that human sense must soon be at the end of its \\nlesson:--the many complexions in a melancholy person; the many seasons in winter; the many nations in \\nthe French; the many ages in age; the many celestial mutations in the conjunction of Venus and Saturn; \\nthe many parts in man\\'s body, nay, in a finger.  And suppose the cure effected, how can we assure \\nourselves that it was not because the disease was arrived at its period, or an effect of chance, or the \\noperation of something else that the child had eaten, drunk, or touched that day, or by virtue of his \\nmother\\'s prayers?  We suppose we see one side of a thing when we are really looking at another.  As for \\nme, I never see all of anything; neither do they who so largely promise to show it to others.  Of the \\nhundred faces that everything has I take one, and am for the most part attracted by some new light I find \\nin it.\"  \\nAnd that new light was sure to lead him back very soon to his \"governing method, ignorance\"--an \\nignorance \"strong and generous, and that yields nothing in honour and courage to knowledge; an \\nignorance, which to conceive requires no less knowledge than to conceive knowledge itself\"--a sapient, \\ninstructed, shrewdly ascertained ignorance, suspended judgment, doubt everywhere.--Balances, very \\ndelicate balances; he was partial to that image of equilibrium, or preponderance, in things.  But was there,\\nafter all, so much as preponderance anywhere?  To Gaston there was a kind of fascination, an actually \\naesthetic beauty, in the spectacle of that keen-edged intelligence, dividing evidence so finely, like some \\nexquisite steel instrument with impeccable sufficiency, always leaving the last word loyally to the central \\nintellectual faculty, in an entire disinterestedness.  If on the one hand he was always distrustful of things \\nthat he wished, on the other he had many opinions he would endeavour to make his son dislike, if he had \\none.  What if the truest opinions were not always the most commodious to man, \"being of so wild a \\ncomposition\"?  He would say nothing to one party that he might not on occasion say to the other, \"with a \\nlittle alteration of accent.\"  Yes!  Doubt, everywhere! doubt in the far background, as the proper intellectual\\nequivalent to the infinite possibilities of things: doubt, shrewdly economising the opportunities of the \\npresent hour, in the very spirit of the traveller who walks only for the walk\\'s sake,--\"every day concludes \\nmy expectation, and the journey of my life is carried on after the same fashion\": doubt, finally, as \"the best\\nof pillows to sleep on.\"  And in fact Gaston did sleep well after those long days of physical and intellectual \\nmovement, in that quiet world, till the spring came round again.  \\nBut beyond and above all the various interests upon which the philosopher\\'s mind was for ever afloat, \\nthere was one subject always in prominence--himself.  His minute peculiarities, mental and physical, what\\nwas constitutional with him as well as his transient humours, how things affected him, what they really \\nwere to him, Michael, much more than man, all this Gaston came to know, as the world knew it afterwards\\nin the Essays, often amused, sometimes irritated, but never suspicious of postures, or insincerity. \\nMontaigne himself admitted his egotism with frank humour:--\"in favour of the Huguenots, who condemn \\nour private confession, I confess myself in public.\"  And this outward egotism of manner was but the \\nsymptom of a certain deeper doctrinal egotism:--\"I have no other end in writing but to discover myself.\"  \\nAnd what was the purport, what the justification, of this undissembled egotism?  It was the recognition, \\nover against, or in continuation of, that world of floating doubt, of the individual mind, as for each one \\nseverally, at once the unique organ, and the only matter, of knowledge,--the wonderful energy, the reality \\nand authority of that, in its absolute loneliness, conforming all things to its law, without witnesses as ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 26}),\n Document(page_content='without judge, without appeal, save to itself. Whatever truth there might be, must come for each one from \\nwithin, not from without. To that wonderful microcosm of the individual soul, of which, for each one, all \\nother worlds are but elements,--to himself,--to what was apparent immediately to him, what was \"properly \\nof his own having and substance\": he confidently dismissed the inquirer.  His own egotism was but the \\npattern of the true intellectual life of every one.  \"The greatest thing in the world is for a man to know that \\nhe is his own.  If the world find fault that I speak too much of myself, I find fault that they do not so much \\nas think of themselves.\"  How it had been \"lodged in its author\":--that, surely, was the essential question, \\nconcerning every opinion that comes to one man from another.  \\nYet, again, even on this ultimate ground of judgment, what undulancy, complexity, surprises!--\"I have no \\nother end in writing but to discover myself, who also shall peradventure be another thing to- morrow.\"  \\nThe great work of his life, the Essays, he placed \"now high, now low, with great doubt and inconstancy.\"  \\n\"What are we but sedition? like this poor France, faction against faction, within ourselves, every piece \\nplaying every moment its own game, with as much difference between us and ourselves as between \\nourselves and others.  Whoever will look narrowly into his own bosom will hardly find himself twice in the \\nsame condition. I give to myself sometimes one face and sometimes another, according to the side I turn \\nto.  I have nothing to say of myself, entirely and without qualification.  One grows familiar with all strange \\nthings by time. But the more I frequent myself and the better I know myself, the less do I understand \\nmyself.  If others would consider themselves as I do, they would find themselves full of caprice.  Rid \\nmyself of it I cannot without making myself away.  They who are not aware of it have the better bargain.  \\nAnd yet I know not whether they have or no!\"  \\nOne\\'s own experience!--that, at least, was one\\'s own: low and earthy, it might be; still, the earth was, \\nemphatically, good, good-natured; and he loved, emphatically, to recommend the wisdom, amid all \\ndoubts, of keeping close to it.  Gaston soon knew well a certain threadbare garment worn by Montaigne in\\nall their rides together, sitting quaintly on his otherwise gallant appointments,--an old mantle that had \\nbelonged to his father.  Retained, as he tells us, in spite of its inconvenience, \"because it seemed to \\nenvelope me in him,\" it was the symbol of a hundred natural, perhaps somewhat material, pieties. \\nParentage, kinship, relationship through earth,--the touch of that was everywhere like a caress to him.  \\nHis fine taste notwithstanding, he loved, in those long rambles, to partake of homely fare, paying largely \\nfor it.  Everywhere it was as if the earth in him turned kindly to earth.  \"Under the sun,\" the sturdy purple \\nthistles, the blossoming burrs also, were worth knowing.  Let us grow together with you! they seem to say.\\n Himself was one of those whom he thought \"Heaven favoured\" in making them die, so naturally, by \\ndegrees.  \"I shall be blind before I am sensible of the decay of my sight, with such kindly artifice do the \\nFatal Sisters entwist our lives.  I melt, and steal away from myself.  How variously is it no longer I!\"  It was \\nnot he who would carry a furry robe at midsummer, because he might need it in the winter.--\"In fine, we \\nmust live among the living, and let the river flow under the bridge without our care, above all things \\navoiding fear, that great disturber of reason.  The thing in the world I am most afraid of is fear.\"  \\nAnd still, health, the invincible survival of youth, \"admonished him to a better wisdom than years and \\nsickness.\"  Was there anything better, fairer, than the beautiful light of health?  To be in health was itself \\nthe sign, perhaps the essence, of wisdom--a wisdom, rich in counsels regarding all one\\'s contacts with \\nthe earthy side of existence.  And how he could laugh!--at that King of Thrace, for instance, who had a \\nreligion and a god all to himself, which his subjects might not presume to worship; at that King of Mexico, \\nwho swore at his coronation not only to keep the laws, but also to make the sun run his annual course; at \\nthose followers of Alexander, who all carried their heads on one side as Alexander did.  The natural \\nsecond-best, the intermediate and unheroic virtue (even the Church, as we know, by no means requiring \\n\"heroic\" virtue), was perhaps actually the best, better than any kind of heroism, in an age whose very \\nvirtues were apt to become insane; an age \"guilty and extravagant\" in its very justice; for which, as \\nregards all that belongs to the spirit, the one thing needful was moderation.  And it was characteristic of \\nMontaigne, a note of the real helpfulness there was in his thoughts, that he preferred to base virtue on \\nlow, safe, ground.  \"The lowest walk is the safest: \\'tis the seat of constancy.\" The wind about the tower, \\ncoming who knows whence and whither?--could one enjoy its music, unless one knew the foundations \\nsafe, twenty feet below-ground?  Always he loved to hear such words as \"soften and modify the temerity \\nof our propositions.\"  To say less than the truth about it, to dissemble the absoluteness of its claim, was \\nagreeable to his confidence in the natural charm, the gaiety, of goodness, \"that fair and beaten path \\nnature has traced for us,\" over against any difficult, militant, or chimerical virtue.--\"Never had any morose \\nand ill-looking physician done anything to purpose.\"  In that age, it was a great thing to be just blameless.

With all his admiration for the antique greatness of \\ncharacter, he would never commend \"so savage a virtue, and one that costs so dear,\" as that, for \\ninstance, of the Greek mother, the Roman father, who assisted to put their own erring sons to death.  \\nMore truly commendable was the custom of the Lacedaemonians, who when they went to battle sacrificed\\nalways to the Muses, that \"these might, by their sweetness and gaiety, soften martial fury.\"  How had \\ndivine philosophy herself been discredited by the sour mask, the sordid patches, with which, her enemies \\nsurely! had sent her abroad into the world.  \"I love a gay and civil philosophy.  There is nothing more \\ncheerful than wisdom: I had like to have said more wanton.\"  \\nWas that why his conversation was sometimes coarse?  \"All the contraries are to be found in me, in one \\ncorner or another\"; if delicacy, so also coarseness.  Delicacy there was, certainly,--a wonderful fineness of\\nsensation.  \"To the end,\" he tells us, \"that sleep should not so stupidly escape from me, I have caused \\nmyself to be disturbed in my sleep, so that I might the better and more sensibly taste and relish it.--Of \\nscents, the simple and natural seem to me the most pleasing, and I have often observed that they cause \\nan alteration in me, and work upon my spirits according to their several virtues.  In excessive heats I \\nalways travel by night, from sunset to sunrise.  I am betimes sensible of the little breezes that begin to \\nsing and whistle in the shrouds, the forerunners of the storm.--When I walk alone in a beautiful orchard, if \\nmy thoughts are for a while taken up with foreign occurrences, I some part of the time call them back \\nagain to my walk, to the orchard, to the sweetness of the solitude, and to myself.--There is nothing in us \\neither purely corporeal, or purely spiritual.  \\'Tis an inhuman wisdom that would have us despise and hate \\nthe culture of the body.  \\'Tis not a soul, \\'tis not a body, we are training up, but a man; and we ought not to \\ndivide him.  Of all the infirmities we have, the most savage is to despise our being.\"  \\nThere was a fineness of sensation in these unpremeditated thoughts, which to Gaston seemed to connect\\nitself with the exquisite words he had found to paint his two great affections, for his father and for Etienne \\nde la Boetie,--a fineness of sensation perhaps quite novel in that age, but still of physical sensation: and \\nin pursuit of fine physical sensation he came, on his broad, easy, indifferent passage through the world, \\nacross the coarsest growths which also thrive \"under the sun,\" and was not revolted.  They were akin to \\nthat ruder earth within himself, of which a kind of undissembled greed was symptomatic; the love of \\n\"meats little roasted, very high, and even, as to several, quite gone\"; while, in drinking, he loved \"clear \\nglass, that the eye might taste too, according to its capacity\"; akin also to a certain \\nslothfulness:--\"Sleeping,\" he says, \"has taken up a great part of my life.\"  And there was almost nothing \\nhe would not say: no fact, no story, from his curious half-medical reading, he would not find some \\nplausible pretext to tell.  Man\\'s kinship to the animal, the material, and all the proofs of it:--he would never \\nblush at them!  In truth, he led the way to the immodesty of French literature; and had his defence, a sort \\nof defence, ready.  \"I know very well that few will quarrel with the licence of my writings, who have not \\nmore to quarrel with in the licence of their own thoughts.\"  \\nYet when Gaston, twenty years afterwards, heard of the seemingly pious end of Monsieur de Montaigne, \\nhe recalled a hundred, always quiet but not always insignificant, acts of devotion, noticeable in those old \\ndays, on passing a village church, or at home, in the little chapel--superstitions, concessions to others, \\nstrictly appropriate recognitions rather, as it might seem, of a certain great possibility, which might lie \\namong the conditions of so complex a world.  That was a point which could hardly escape so reflective a \\nmind as Gaston\\'s: and at a later period of his life, at the harvest of his own second thoughts, as he \\npondered on the influence over him of that two-sided thinker, the opinion that things as we find them \\nwould bear a certain old-fashioned construction, seemed to have been the consistent motive, however \\nsecret and subtle in its working, of Montaigne\\'s sustained intellectual activity.  A lowly philosophy of \\nignorance would not be likely to disallow or discredit whatever intimations there might be, in the \\nexperience of the wise or of the simple, in favour of a venerable religion, which from its long history had \\ncome to seem like a growth of nature.  Somewhere, among men\\'s seemingly random and so inexplicable \\napprehensions, might lie the grains of a wisdom more precious than gold, or even its priceless pearl.  That\\n\"free and roving thing,\" the human soul--what might it not have found out for itself, in a world so wide?  To', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 28}),\n Document(page_content='deny, at all events, would be only \"to limit the mind, by negation.\"  \\nIt was not however this side of that double philosophy which recommended itself just now to Gaston.  The\\nmaster\\'s wistful tolerance, so extraordinary a characteristic in that age, attracted him, in his present \\nhumour, not so much in connexion with those problematic heavenly lights that might find their way to one \\nfrom infinite skies, as with the pleasant, quite finite, objects and experiences of the indubitable world of \\nsense, so close around him. Over against the world\\'s challenge to make trial of it, here was that general \\nlicence, which his own warm and curious appetite just then demanded of the moral theorist.  For so \\npronounced a lover of sincerity as Monsieur de Montaigne, there was certainly a strange ambiguousness \\nin the result of his lengthy inquiries, on the greatest as well as on the lightest matters, and it was \\ninevitable that a listener should accept the dubious lesson in his own sense.  Was this shrewd casuist \\nonly bringing him by a roundabout way to principles he would not have cared to avow?  To the great \\nreligious thinker of the next century, to Pascal, Montaigne was to figure as emphatically on the wrong \\nside, not merely because \"he that is not with us, is against us.\"  It was something to have been, in the \\nmatter of religious tolerance, as on many other matters of justice and gentleness, the solitary conscience \\nof the age.  But could one really care for truth, who never even seemed to find it?  Did he fear, perhaps, \\nthe practical responsibility of getting to the very bottom of certain questions?  That the actual discourse of \\nso keen a thinker appeared often inconsistent or inconsecutive, might be a hint perhaps that there was \\nsome deeper ground of thought in reserve; as if he were really moving, securely, over ground you did not \\nsee. What might that ground be?  As to Gaston himself,--had this kindly entertainer only been drawing the\\nscrews of a very complex piece of machinery which had worked well enough hitherto for all practical \\npurposes?--Was this all that had been going on, while he lingered there, week after week, in a kind of \\ndevout attendance on theories, and, for his part, feeling no reverberation of actual events around him, still \\nless of great events in preparation?  These were the questions Gaston had in mind, as, at length, he \\nthanked his host one morning with real regret, and took his last look around that meditative place, the \\nmanuscripts, the books, the emblems,--the house of Circe on the wall.  \\n  \\nCHAPTER VI.  SHADOWS OF EVENTS  \\n  \\nWe all feel, I suppose, the pathos of that mythic situation in Homer, where the Greeks at the last throb of \\nbattle around the body of Patroclus find the horror of supernatural darkness added to their other foes; feel \\nit through some touch of truth to our own experience how the malignancy of the forces against us may be \\ndoubled by their uncertainty and the resultant confusion of one\\'s own mind--blindfold night there too, at \\nthe moment when daylight and self-possession are indispensable.  \\nIn that old dream-land of the Iliad such darkness is the work of a propitiable deity, and withdrawn at its \\npleasure; in life, it often persists obstinately.  It was so with the agents on the terrible Eve of St. \\nBartholomew, 1572, when a man\\'s foes were those of his own household.  An ambiguity of motive and \\ninfluence, a confusion of spirit amounting, as we approach the centre of action, to physical madness, \\nencompasses those who are formally responsible for things; and the mist around that great crime, or \\ngreat \"accident,\" in which the gala weather of Gaston\\'s coming to Paris broke up, leaving a sullenness \\nbehind it to remain for a generation, has never been penetrated.  The doubt with which Charles the Ninth \\nwould seem to have left the world, doubt as to his own complicity therein, as well as to the precise nature,\\nthe course and scope, of the event itself, is still unresolved.  So it was with Gaston also.  The incident in \\nhis life which opened for him the profoundest sources of regret and pity, shaped as it was in a measure by\\nthose greater historic movements, owed its tragic significance there to an unfriendly shadow precluding \\nknowledge how certain facts had really gone, a shadow which veiled from others a particular act of his \\nand the true character of its motives.  \\nFor, the scene of events being now contracted very closely to Paris, the predestined actors therein were \\ngradually drawn thither as into some narrow battlefield or slaughter-house or fell trap of destiny, and \\nGaston, all unconsciously, along with them--he and his private fortunes involved in those larger ones.  \\nResult of chance, or fate, or cunning prevision, there are in the acts great and little--the acts and the \\nwords alike--of the king and his associates, at this moment, coincidences which give them at least \\nsuperficially the colour of an elaborate conspiracy. Certainly, as men looked back afterwards, all the \\nseemingly random doings of those restless months ending in the Noces Vermeilles marriage of Henry of \\nNavarre with Margaret of France, lent themselves agreeably to the theory of a great plot to crush out at \\none blow, in the interest of the reigning Valois, not the Huguenots only but the rival houses of Guise and ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 29}),\n Document(page_content='Bourbon.  The word, the act, from hour to hour through what presented itself at the time as a \\nlong-continued season of frivolity, suggested in retrospect alike to friend and foe the close connexion of a \\nmathematical problem.  And yet that damning coincidence of date, day and hour apparently so exactly \\ntimed, in the famous letter to the Governor of Lyons, by which Charles, the trap being now ready, seems \\nto shut all the doors upon escaping victims, is admitted even by Huguenot historians to have been \\nfortuitous.  Gaston, recalling to mind the actual mien of Charles as be passed to and fro across the \\nchimeric scene, timid, and therefore constitutionally trustful towards older persons, filially kissing the hand \\nof the grim Coligni- -Mon père!  Mon père!--all his câlineries in that age of courtesy and \\nassassinations--would wonder always in time to come, as the more equitable sort of historians have done,\\nwhat amount of guilty foresight the young king had carried in his bosom.  And this ambiguity regarding the\\nnearest agent in so great a crime, adding itself to the general mystery of life, touched Gaston duly with a \\nsense of the dim melancholy of man\\'s position in the world.  It might seem the function of some cruel or \\nmerely whimsical power, thus, by the flinging of mere dust through the air, to double our actual \\nmisfortunes.  However carefully the critical intelligence in him might trim the balance, his imagination at all\\nevents would never be clear of the more plausible construction of events.  In spite of efforts not to \\nmisjudge, in proportion to the clearness with which he recalled the visible footsteps of the \"accursed\" \\nValois, he saw them, irresistibly, in connexion with the end actually reached, moving to the sounds of \\nwedding music, through a world of dainty gestures, amid sonnets and flowers, and perhaps the most \\nrefined art the world has seen, to their surfeit of blood.  \\nAnd if those \"accursed\" Valois might plead to be judged refinedly, so would Gaston, had the opportunity \\ncome, have pleaded not to be misunderstood.  Of the actual event he was not a spectator, and his \\nsudden absence from Paris at that moment seemed to some of those he left there only a cruelly \\ncharacteristic incident in the great treachery.  Just before that delirious night set in, the news that his old \\ngrandfather lay mortally sick at Deux-manoirs had snatched him away to watch by the dying bed, amid the\\npeaceful ministries of the religion which was even then filling the houses of Paris with blood.  But the \\nyellow-haired woman, light of soul, whose husband he had become by dubious and irregular Huguenot \\nrites, the religious sanction of which he hardly recognised--flying after his last tender kiss, with the babe in\\nher womb, from the ruins of her home, and the slaughter of her kinsmen, supposed herself treacherously \\ndeserted.  For him, on the other hand, \"the pity of it,\" the pity of the thing supplied all that had been \\nwanting in its first consecration, and made the lost mistress really a wife.  His recoil from that damaging \\ntheory of his conduct brought home to a sensitive conscience the fact that there had indeed been a \\nmeasure of self-indulgent weakness in his acts, and made him the creature for the rest of his days of \\nsomething like remorse.  \\nThe gaiety, the strange devils\\' gaiety of France, at least in all places whither its royalty came, ended \\nappropriately in a marriage--a marriage of \"The Reform\" in the person of Prince Henry of Navarre, to \\nCatholicism in the person of Margaret of Valois, Margaret of the \"Memoirs,\" Charles\\'s sister, in tacit \\ndefiance of, or indifference to, the Pope.  With the great Huguenot leaders, with the princes of the house \\nof Guise, and the Court, like one united family, all in gaudy evidence in its streets, Paris, ever with an eye \\nfor the chance of amusement, always preoccupied with the visible side of things, always Catholic--was \\nbidden to be tolerant for a moment, to carry no fire-arms under penalties, \"to renew no past quarrels,\" and\\ndraw no sword in any new one.  It was the perfect stroke of Catherine\\'s policy, the secret of her \\npredominance over her sons, thus, with a flight of purchaseable fair women ever at command, to maintain\\nperpetual holiday, perpetual idleness, with consequent perpetual, most often idle, thoughts about \\nmarriage, amid which the actual conduct of affairs would be left to herself.  Yet for Paris thus Catholic, \\nthere was certainly, even if the Pope were induced to consent, and the Huguenot bride-groom to \\n\"conform,\" something illicit and inauspicious about this marriage within the prohibited degrees of kinship.  \\nIn fact, the cunningly sought papal dispensation never came; Charles, with apparent unconcern, fulfilled \\nhis threat, and did without it; must needs however trick the old Cardinal de Bourbon into performing his \\noffice, not indeed \"in the face of the Church,\" but in the open air outside the doors of the cathedral of \\nNotre-Dame, the Catholics quietly retiring into the interior, when that starveling ceremony was over, to \\nhear the nuptial mass.  Still, the open air, the August sunshine, had lent the occasion an irresistible \\nphysical gaiety in this hymeneal Assumption weather.  Paris, suppressing its scruples, its conscientious \\nand unconscientious hatreds, at least for a season, had adorned herself as that fascinating city always \\nhas been able to adorn herself, if with something of artifice, certainly with great completeness, almost to \\nillusion.  Whatever gloom the Middle Age with its sins and sorrows might have left there, was under ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 30}),\n Document(page_content='gallant disguise to-day.  In the train of the young married people, jeunes premiers in an engagement \\nwhich was to turn out almost as transitory as a stage-play, a long month of masquerade meandered night \\nand day through the public places.  His carnality and hers, so startling in their later developments, showed\\nnow in fact but as the engaging force of youth, since youth, however unpromising its antecedents, can \\nnever have sinned irretrievably.  Yet to curious retrospective minds not long afterwards, these graceful \\nfollies would seem tragic or allegoric, with an undercurrent of infernal irony throughout.  Charles and his \\ntwo brothers, keeping the gates of a mimic paradise in the court of the Louvre, while the fountains ran \\nwine--were they already thinking of a time when they would keep those gates, with iron purpose, while the\\ngutters ran blood?  \\nIf Huguenots were disgusted with the frivolities of the hour, passing on the other side of the street in sad \\nattire, plotting, as some have thought, as their enemies will persuade the Pope, a yet more terrible \\nmassacre of their own, only anticipated by the superior force and shrewdness of the Catholics, on the \\nvery eve of its accomplishment-- they did but serve just now to relieve the predominant white and red, and\\nthereby double the brilliancy, of a gay picture.  Yet a less than Machiavellian cunning might perhaps have \\ndetected, amid all this sudden fraternity--as in some unseasonably fine weather signs of coming \\ndistress--a risky element of exaggeration in those precipitately patched-up amities, a certain hollow ring in\\nthose improbable religious conversions, those unlikely reconciliations in what was after all an age of \\ntreachery as a fine art.  With Gaston, however, the merely receptive and poetic sense of life was \\nabundantly occupied with the spectacular value of the puissant figures in motion around him.  If he went \\nbeyond the brilliancy of the present moment in his wonted pitiful equitable after-thoughts, he was still \\nconcerned only with the more general aspects of the human lot, and did not reflect that every public \\nmovement, however generous in its tendency, is really flushed to active force by identification with some \\nnarrower personal or purely selfish one.  Coligni, \"the Admiral,\" centre of Huguenot opposition, just, kind, \\ngrim, to the height of inspired genius, the grandest character his faith had yet produced--undeterred by \\nthose ominous voices (of aged women and the like) which are apt to beset all great actions, yielded \\nreadily to the womanish endearments of Charles, his filial words and fond touching of the hands, the face,\\naged at fifty-five--just this portion of his conduct let us hope being exclusive of his precise share in the \\n\"conspiracy.\"  And the opportune death in Paris of the Huguenot Queen of Navarre only stirred question \\nfor a moment: autopsy revealed no traces of unfair play, though at a time credulous as to impossible \\npoisoned perfumes and such things, romantic in its very suspicions.  \\nDelirium was in the air already charged with thunder, and laid hold on Gaston too.  It was as if through \\nsome unsettlement in the atmospheric medium the objects around no longer acted upon the senses with \\nthe normal result.  Looking back afterwards, this singularly self-possessed person had to confess that \\nunder its influence he had lost for a while the exacter view of certain outlines, certain real differences and \\noppositions of things in that hotly coloured world of Paris (like a shaken tapestry about him) awaiting the \\nEve of Saint Bartholomew.  Was the \"undulant\" philosophy of Monsieur de Montaigne, in collusion with \\nthis dislocating time, at work upon him, that, following with only too entire a mobility the experience of the \\nhour, he found himself more than he could have thought possible the toy of external accident?  Lodged in \\nAbelard\\'s quarter, he all but repeats Abelard\\'s typical experience.  His new Heloise, with capacities \\ndoubtless, as he reflected afterwards regretfully, for a refined and serious happiness, although actually so \\nfar only a man\\'s plaything, sat daintily amid her posies and painted potteries in the window of a house \\nitself as forbidding and stern as her kinsmen, busy Huguenot printers, well-to-do at a time not only fertile \\nin new books and new editions, but profuse of tracts, sheets, satiric handbills for posting all over France.  \\nGaston\\'s curiosity, a kind of fascination he finds in their dark ways, takes him among them on occasion, to\\nfeel all the more keenly the contrast of that picture- like prettiness in this framing of their grim company, \\ntheir grim abode.  Her frivolity is redeemed by a sensitive affection for these people who protect her, by a \\nself-accusing respect for their religion, for the somewhat surly goodness, the hard and unattractive pieties \\ninto which she cannot really enter; and she yearns after her like, for those harmless forbidden graces \\ntowards which she has a natural aptitude, loses her heart to Gaston as he goes to and fro, wastes her \\ndays in reminiscence of that bright passage, notes the very fineness of his linen.  To him, in turn, she \\nseems, as all longing creatures ever have done, to have some claim upon him--a right to consideration--to\\nan effort on his part: he finds a sister to encourage: she touches him, clings where she touches.  The \\ngloomy, honest, uncompromising Huguenot brothers interfere just in time to save her from the \\nconsequence of what to another than Gaston might have counted as only a passing fondness to be soon \\nforgotten; and the marriage almost forced upon him seemed under its actual conditions no binding ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 31}),\n Document(page_content='sacrament. A marriage really indissoluble in itself, and for the heart of Colombe sacramental, as he came \\nafterwards to understand--for his own conscience at the moment, the transaction seemed to have but the \\ntransitoriness, as also the guilt of a vagrant love.  A connexion so light of motive, so inexpressive of what \\nseemed the leading forces of his character, he might, but for the sorrow which stained its actual issue, \\nhave regarded finally as a mere mistake, or an unmeaning accident in his career.  \\nColigni lay suffering in the fiery August from the shot of the ambiguous assassin which had missed his \\nheart, amid the real or feigned regrets of the Guises, of the royal family, of his true friends, wondering as \\nthey watched whether the bullet had been a poisoned one.  The other Huguenot leaders had had their \\nwarnings to go home, as the princes of the house of Navarre, Condé and Henry of Bearn, would fain have\\ndone--the gallant world about them being come just now to have certain suspicious resemblances to a \\nprison or a trap.  Under order of the king the various quarters of Paris had been distributed for some \\nunrevealed purpose of offence or defence.  To the officers in immediate charge it was intimated that \\n\"those of the new religion\" designed \"to rise against the king\\'s authority, to the trouble of his subjects and \\nthe city of Paris.  For the prevention of which conspiracy the king enjoined the Provost to possess himself \\nof the keys of the various city gates, and seize all boats plying on the river, to the end that none might \\nenter or depart.\" And just before the lists close around the doomed, Gaston has bounded away on his \\nroad homeward to the bed of the dying grandfather, after embracing his wife, anxious, if she might, to \\nshare his journey, with some forecast of coming evil among those dark people.  \\nThe white badges of Catholicism had been distributed, not to every Catholic (a large number of Catholics \\nperished), to some Huguenots such as La Rochefoucauld, brave guerrier et joyeux compagnon, dear to \\nCharles, hesitating still with some last word of conscience in his ear at the very gate of the Louvre, when a\\nrandom pistol-shot, in the still undisturbed August night, rousing sudden fear for himself, precipitates the \\nevent, and as if in delirium he is driven forth on the scent of human blood.  He had always hunted like a \\nmadman.  It was thus \"the matins of Paris\" began, in which not religious zealots only assisted, but the \\nthieves, the wanton, the unemployed, the reckless children, les enfants massacreurs like those seen \\ndragging an insulted dead body to the Seine, greed or malice or the desire for swift settlement of some \\nlong-pending law-suit finding here an opportunity.  A religious pretext had brought into sudden evidence \\nall the latent ferocities of a corrupt though dainty civilisation, and while the stairways of the Louvre, the \\nstreets, the vile trap-doors of Paris, run blood, far away at Deux-manoirs Gaston watches as the light \\ncreeps over the silent cornfields, the last sense of it in those aged eyes now ebbing softly away.  The \\nvillage priest, almost as aged, assists patiently with his immemorial consolations at this long, leisurely, \\nscarce perceptible ending to a long, leisurely life, on the quiet double-holiday morning.*  \\nThe wild news of public disaster, penetrating along the country roads now bristling afresh with signs of \\nuniversal war, seemed of little consequence in comparison with that closer grief at home, which made just\\nthen the more effective demand on his sympathy, till the thought came of the position of Colombe--his \\nwife left behind there in Paris. Immediate rumour, like subsequent history, gave variously the number- -the\\nnumber of thousands--who perished.  The great Huguenot leader was dead, one party at least, the royal \\nparty, safe for the moment and in high spirits.  As Charles himself put it, the ancient private quarrel \\nbetween the houses of Guise and Chatillon was ended by the decease of the chief of the latter, Coligni de\\nChâtillon--a death so saintly after its new fashion that the long-delayed vengeance of Henri de Guise on \\nthe presumed instigator of the murder of his father seemed a martyrdom.  And around that central \\nbarbarity the slaughter had spread over Paris in widening circles.  With conflicting thoughts, in wild terror \\nand grief, Gaston seeks the footsteps of Colombe, of her people, from their rifled and deserted house to \\nthe abodes of their various acquaintance, like the traces of wrecked men under deep water.  Yet even \\namid his private distress, queries on points of more general interest in the event would not be excluded. \\nWith whom precisely, in whose interest had the first guilty motion been?--Gaston on the morrow asked in \\nvain as the historian asks still.  And more and more as he picked his way among the direful records of the \\nlate massacre, not the cruelty only but the obscurity, the accidental character, yet, alas! also the \\ntreachery, of the public event seemed to identify themselves tragically with his own personal action.  \\nThose queries, those surmises were blent with the enigmatic sense of his own helplessness amid the \\nobscure forces around him, which would fain compromise the indifferent, and had made him so far an \\naccomplice in their unfriendly action that he felt certainly not quite guiltless, thinking of his own \\nirresponsible, self-centered, passage along the ways, through the weeks that had ended in the public \\ncrime and his own private sorrow.  Pity for those unknown or half-known neighbours whose faces he must\\noften have looked on--ces pauvres morts!--took an almost remorseful character from his grief for the ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 32}),\n Document(page_content='delicate creature whose vain longings had been perhaps but a rudimentary aptitude for the really high \\nthings himself had represented to her fancy, the refined happiness to which he might have helped her.  \\nThe being whose one claim had lain in her incorrigible lightness, came to seem representative of the \\nsuffering of the whole world in its plenitude of piteous detail, in those unvalued caresses, that desire \\ntowards himself, that patient half- expressed claim not to be wholly despised, poignant now for ever. For \\nhe failed to find her: and her brothers being presumably dead, all he could discover of a certainty from the\\nlast survivor of her more distant kinsmen was the fact of her flight into the country, already in labour it was\\nthought, and in the belief that she had been treacherously deserted, like many another at that great crisis. \\nIn the one place in the neighbourhood of Paris with which his knowledge connected her he seeks further \\ntidings, but hears only of her passing through it, as of a passage into vague infinite space; a little onward, \\ndimly of her death, with the most damaging view of his own conduct presented with all the condemnatory \\nresources of Huguenot tongues, but neither of the place nor the circumstances of that event, nor whether,\\nas seemed hardly probable, the child survived. It was not till many years afterwards that he stood by her \\ngrave, still with no softening of the cruel picture driven then as with fire into his soul; her affection, her \\nconfidence in him still contending with the suspicions, the ill-concealed antipathy to him of her hostile \\nbrothers, the distress of her flight, half in dread to find the husband she was pursuing with the wildness of \\nsome lost child, who seeking its parents begins to suspect treacherous abandonment. That most \\nmortifying view of his actions had doubtless been further enforced on her by others, the worst possible \\nreading, to her own final discomfiture, of a not unfaithful heart.  \\n  \\nCHAPTER VII.  THE LOWER PANTHEISM  \\n  \\nThose who were curious to trace the symmetries of chance or destiny felt now quite secure in observing \\nthat, of nine French kings of the name, every third Charles had been a madman.  Over the exotic, nervous\\ncreature who had inherited so many delicacies of organisation, the coarse rage or rabies of the wolf, part, \\ndoubtless, of an inheritance older still, had asserted itself on that terrible night of Saint Bartholomew, at \\nthe mere sight, the scent, of blood, in the crime he had at least allowed others to commit; and it was not \\nan unfriendly witness who recorded that, the fever once upon him, for an hour he had been less a man \\nthan a beast of prey.  But, exemplifying that exquisite fineness of cruelty proper to an ideal tragedy, with \\nthe work of his madness all around him, he awoke sane next day, to remain so--aged at \\ntwenty-one--seeking for the few months left him to forget himself in his old out-of-door amusements, \\nrending a consumptive bosom with the perpetual horn-blowing which could never rouse again the gay \\nmorning of life.  \\n\"I have heard,\" says Brantome, of Elisabeth, Charles\\'s queen, \"that on the Eve of Saint Bartholomew, \\nshe, having no knowledge of the matter, went to rest at her accustomed hour, and, sleeping till the \\nmorning, was told, as she arose, of the brave mystery then playing. \\'Alas!\\' she cried; \\'the king! my \\nhusband! does he know it?\\'  \\'Ay! Madam,\\' they answered; \\'the king himself has ordained it.\\'  \\'God!\\' she \\ncried; \\'how is this? and what counsellors be they who have given him this advice?  O God, be pitiful! for \\nunless Thou art pitiful I fear this offence will never be pardoned unto him;\\' and asking for her \\'Hours,\\' \\nsuddenly betook herself to prayer, weeping.\"  \\nLike the shrinking, childish Elisabeth, the Pope also wept at that dubious service to his Church from one \\nwho was, after all, a Huguenot in belief; and Huguenots themselves pitied his end.--\"Ah!  ces pauvres \\nmorts! que j\\'ai eu un meschant conseil!  Ah! ma nourrice! ma mie, ma nourrice! que de sang, et que de \\nmeurtres!\"  \\nIt was a peculiarity of the naturally devout Gaston that, habituated to yield himself to the poetic guidance \\nof the Catholic Church in her wonderful, year-long, dramatic version of the story of redemption, he had \\never found its greatest day least evocative of proportionate sympathy.  The sudden gaieties of Easter \\nmorning, the congratulations to the Divine Mother, the sharpness of the recoil from one extreme of feeling \\nto the other, for him never cleared away the Lenten pre-occupation with Christ\\'s death and passion: the \\nempty tomb, with the white clothes lying, was still a tomb: there was no human warmth in the \"spiritual \\nbody\": the white flowers, after all, were those of a funeral, with a mortal coldness, amid the loud Alleluias, \\nwhich refused to melt at the startling summons, any more than the earth will do in the March morning \\nbecause we call it Spring.  It was altogether different with that other festival which celebrates the Descent \\nof the Spirit, the tongues, the nameless impulses gone all abroad, to soften slowly, to penetrate, all things,\\nas with the winning subtlety of nature, or of human genius.  The gracious Pentecostal fire seemed to be in', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 33}),\n Document(page_content='alliance with the sweet, warm, relaxing winds of that later, securer, season, bringing their spicy burden \\nfrom unseen sources.  Into the close world, like a walled garden, about him, influences from remotest time\\nand space found their way, travelling unerringly on their long journeys, as if straight to him, with the \\nassurance that things were not wholly left to themselves; yet so unobtrusively that, a little later, the \\ntransforming spiritual agency would be discernible at most in the grateful cry of an innocent child, in some \\ngood deed of a bad man, or unlooked-for gentleness of a rough one, in the occasional turning to music of \\na rude voice.  Through the course of years during which Gaston was to remain in Paris, very close to \\nother people\\'s sins, interested, all but entangled, in a world of corruption in flower (pleasantly enough to \\nthe eye), those influences never failed him. At times it was as if a legion of spirits besieged his door: \\n\"Open unto me!  Open unto me!  My sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled!\" And one result, certainly, of \\nthis constant prepossession was, that it kept him on the alert concerning theories of the divine assistance \\nto man, and the world,--theories of inspiration.  On the Feast of Pentecost, on the afternoon of the thirtieth\\nof May, news of the death of Charles the Ninth had gone abroad promptly, with large rumours as to the \\nmanner of it.  Those streams of blood blent themselves fantastically in Gaston\\'s memory of the event with \\nthe gaudy colours of the season--the crazy red trees in blossom upon the heated sky above the old grey \\nwalls; like a fiery sunset, it might seem, as he looked back over the ashen intervening years.  To Charles\\'s\\nsuccessor (he and the Queen-mother now delightfully secure from fears, however unreasonable, of \\nCharles\\'s jerking dagger) the day became a sweet one, to be noted unmistakably by various pious and \\nother observances, which still further fixed the thought of that Sunday on Gaston\\'s mind, with continual \\nsurmise as to the tendencies of so complex and perplexing a scene.  \\nThe last words of Charles had asserted his satisfaction in leaving no male child to wear his crown.  But \\nthe brother, whose obvious kingly qualities, the chief facts really known of him so far, Charles was thought\\nto have envied--the gallant feats of his youth, de ses Jeunes guerres, his stature, his high-bred beauty, \\nhis eloquence, his almost pontifical refinement and grace,--had already promptly deserted the \\nhalf-barbarous kingdom, his acceptance of which had been but the mask of banishment; though he \\ndelayed much on his way to the new one, passing round through the cities of Venice and Lombardy, \\nseductive schools of the art of life as conceived by Italian epicures, of which he became only too ready a \\nstudent.  On Whit-Monday afternoon, while Charles \"went in lead,\" amid very little private or public \\nconcern, to join his kinsfolk at Saint-Denys, Paris was already looking out for its new king, following, \\nthrough doubtful rumour, his circuitous journey to the throne, by Venice, Padua, Ferrara, Mantua, Turin, \\nover Mont Cenis, by Lyons, to French soil, still building confidently on the prestige of his early manhood.  \\nSeeing him at last, all were conscious in a moment of the inversion of their hopes. Had the old witchcrafts \\nof Poland, the old devilries of his race, laid visible hold on the hopeful young man, that he must now take \\npurely satiric estimate of so great an opportunity, with a programme which looked like formal irony on the \\nkingly position, a premeditated mockery of those who yielded him, on demand, a servile reverence never \\nbefore paid to any French monarch?  Well! the amusement, or business, of Parisians, at all events, would \\nstill be that of spectators, assisting at the last act of the Valois tragedy, in the course of which fantastic \\ntraits and incidents would naturally be multiplied.  Fantastic humour seemed at its height in the institution \\nof a new order of knighthood, the enigmatic splendours of which were to be a monument of Henry\\'s \\nsuperstitious care, or, as some said, of his impious contempt, of the day which had made him master of \\nhis destiny,--that great Church festival, towards the emphatic marking of which he was ever afterwards \\nready to welcome any novel or striking device for the spending of an hour.  \\nIt was on such an occasion, then,--on a Whitsunday afternoon, amid the gaudy red hues of the season, \\nthat Gaston listened to one, who, as if with some intentional new version of the sacred event then \\ncommemorated, had a great deal to say concerning the Spirit; above all, of the freedom, the indifference, \\nof its operations; and who would give a strangely altered colour, for a long time to come, to the thoughts, \\nto the very words, associated with the celebration of Pentecost.  The speaker, though understood to be a \\nbrother of the Order of Saint Dominic, had not been present at the mass--the daily University red mass, \\nDe Spiritu Sancto, but said to-day according to the proper course of the season in the chapel of the \\nSorbonne, with much pomp, by the Italian Bishop of Paris.  It was the reign of the Italians just then, a \\ndoubly refined, somewhat morbid, somewhat ash- coloured, Italy in France, more Italian still.  What our \\nElisabethan poets imagined about Italian culture--forcing all they knew of Italy to an ideal of dainty sin \\nsuch as had never actually existed there,-- that the court of Henry, so far as in it lay, realised in fact.  Men \\nof Italian birth, \"to the great suspicion of simple people,\" swarmed in Paris, already \"flightier, less \\nconstant, than the girouettes on its steeples\"; and it was love for Italian fashions that had brought king and', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 34}),\n Document(page_content='courtiers here this afternoon, with great éclat, as they said, frizzed and starched, in the beautiful, minutely \\nconsidered, dress of the moment, pressing the learned University itself into the background; for the \\npromised speaker, about whom tongues had been busy, not only in the Latin quarter, had come from \\nItaly.  In an age in which all things about which Parisians much cared must be Italian, there might be a \\nhearing for Italian philosophy.  Courtiers at least would understand Italian; and this speaker was rumoured\\nto possess in perfection all the curious arts of his native language. And of all the kingly qualities of Henry\\'s\\nyouth, the single one which had held by him was that gift of eloquence he was able also to value in \\nothers; an inherited gift perhaps, for amid all contemporary and subsequent historic gossip about his \\nmother, the two things certain are, that the hands credited with so much mysterious ill- doing were fine \\nones, and that she was an admirable speaker.  \\nBruno himself tells us, long after he had withdrawn himself from it, that the monastic life promotes the \\nfreedom of the intellect by its silence and self-concentration.  The prospect of such freedom sufficiently \\nexplains why a young man who, however well-found in worldly and personal advantages, was above all \\nconscious of great intellectual possessions, and of fastidious spirit also, with a remarkable distaste for the \\nvulgar, should have espoused poverty, chastity, and obedience, in a Dominican cloister.  What liberty of \\nmind may really come to, in such places, what daring new departures it may suggest even to the strictly \\nmonastic temper, is exemplified by the dubious and dangerous mysticism of men like John of Parma and \\nJoachim of Flora, the reputed author of a new \"Everlasting Gospel\"; strange dreamers, in a world of \\nsanctified rhetoric, of that later dispensation of the Spirit, in which all law will have passed away; or again \\nby a recognised tendency, in the great rival Order of Saint Francis, in the so-called \"spiritual\" Franciscans,\\nto understand the dogmatic words of faith, with a difference.  \\nThe three convents in which successively Bruno had lived, at Naples, at Città di Campagna, and finally \\nthe Minerva at Rome, developed freely, we may suppose, all the mystic qualities of a genius, in which, \\nfrom the first, a heady southern imagination took the lead. But it was from beyond monastic bounds that \\nhe would look for the sustenance, the fuel, of an ardour born or bred within them.  Amid such artificial \\nreligious stillness the air itself becomes generous in undertones.  The vain young monk (vain, of course) \\nwould feed his vanity by puzzling the good, sleepy heads of the average sons of Dominic with his \\nneology, putting new wine into old bottles, teaching them their own business, the new, higher, truer sense \\nof the most familiar terms, of the chapters they read, the hymns they sang; above all, as it happened, \\nevery word that referred to the Spirit, the reign of the Spirit, and its excellent freedom.  He would soon \\npass beyond the utmost possible limits of his brethren\\'s sympathy, beyond the largest and freest \\ninterpretation such words would bear, to words and thoughts on an altogether different plane, of which the\\nfull scope was only to be felt in certain old pagan writers,--pagan, though approached, perhaps, at first, as\\nhaving a kind of natural, preparatory, kinship with Scripture itself.  The Dominicans would seem to have \\nhad well-stocked, and liberally-selected, libraries; and this curious youth, in that age of restored letters, \\nread eagerly, easily, and very soon came to the kernel of a difficult old author, Plotinus or Plato,--to the \\nreal purpose of thinkers older still, surviving by glimpses only in the books of others, Empedocles, for \\ninstance, and Pythagoras, who had been nearer the original sense of things; Parmenides, above all, that \\nmost ancient assertor of God\\'s identity with the world.  The affinities, the unity, of the visible and the \\ninvisible, of earth and heaven, of all things whatever, with one another, through the consciousness, the \\nperson, of God the Spirit, who was at every moment of infinite time, in every atom of matter, at every point\\nof infinite space; aye! was everything, in turn: that doctrine--l\\'antica filosofia Italiana--was in all its vigour \\nthere, like some hardy growth out of the very heart of nature, interpreting itself to congenial minds with all \\nthe fulness of primitive utterance.  A big thought! yet suggesting, perhaps, from the first, in still, small, \\nimmediately practical, voice, a freer way of taking, a possible modification of, certain moral precepts. A \\nprimitive morality,--call it! congruous with those larger primitive ideas, with that larger survey, with the \\nearlier and more liberal air.  \\nReturning to this ancient \"pantheism,\" after the long reign of a seemingly opposite faith, Bruno \\nunfalteringly asserts \"the vision of all things in God\" to be the aim of all metaphysical speculation, as of all \\nenquiry into nature.  The Spirit of God, in countless variety of forms, neither above, nor in any way \\nwithout, but intimately within, all things, is really present, with equal integrity and fulness, in the sunbeam \\nninety millions of miles long, and the wandering drop of water as it evaporates therein.  The divine \\nconsciousness has the same relation to the production of things as the human intelligence to the \\nproduction of true thoughts concerning them.  Nay! those thoughts are themselves actually God in man: a \\nloan to man also of His assisting Spirit, who, in truth, is the Creator of things, in and by His contemplation ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 35}),\n Document(page_content='of them.  For Him, as for man in proportion as man thinks truly, thought and being are identical, and things\\nexistent only in so far as they are known.  Delighting in itself, in the sense of its own energy, this \\nsleepless, capacious, fiery intelligence, evokes all the orders of nature, all the revolutions of history, cycle \\nupon cycle, in ever new types.  And God the Spirit, the soul of the world, being therefore really identical \\nwith the soul of Bruno also, as the universe shapes itself to Bruno\\'s reason, to his imagination, ever more \\nand more articulately, he too becomes a sharer of the divine joy in that process of the formation of true \\nideas, which is really parallel to the process of creation, to the evolution of things.  In a certain mystic \\nsense, which some in every age of the world have understood, he, too, is the creator; himself actually a \\nparticipator in the creative function. And by such a philosophy, Bruno assures us, it was his experience \\nthat the soul is greatly expanded: con questa filosofia l\\'anima mi s\\'aggrandisce: mi se magnifica \\nl\\'intelletto!  \\nFor, with characteristic largeness of mind, Bruno accepted this theory in the whole range of its \\nconsequences.  Its more immediate corollary was the famous axiom of \"indifference,\" of \"the coincidence \\nof contraries.\"  To the eye of God, to the philosophic vision through which God sees in man, nothing is \\nreally alien from Him.  The differences of things, those distinctions, above all, which schoolmen and \\npriests, old or new, Roman or Reformed, had invented for themselves, would be lost in the length and \\nbreadth of the philosophic survey: nothing, in itself, being really either great or small; and matter certainly, \\nin all its various forms, not evil but divine.  Dare one choose or reject this or that?  If God the Spirit had \\nmade, nay! was, all things indifferently, then, matter and spirit, the spirit and the flesh, heaven and earth, \\nfreedom and necessity, the first and the last, good and evil, would be superficial rather than substantial \\ndifferences.  Only, were joy and sorrow also, together with another distinction, always of emphatic reality \\nto Gaston, for instance, to be added to the list of phenomena really \"coincident,\" or \"indifferent,\" as some \\nintellectual kinsmen of Bruno have claimed they should?  \\nThe Dominican brother was at no distant day to break far enough away from the election, the seeming \\n\"vocation,\" of his youth, yet would remain always, and under all circumstances, unmistakably a monk in \\nsome predominant qualities of temper.  At first it was only by way of thought that he asserted his \\nliberty--delightful, late-found, privilege!--traversing, in strictly mental journeys, that spacious circuit, as it \\nbroke away before him at every moment upon ever-new horizons.  Kindling thought and imagination at \\nonce, the prospect draws from him cries of joy, of a kind of religious joy, as in some new \"canticle of the \\ncreatures,\" some new hymnal, or antiphonary. \"Nature\" becomes for him a sacred term.--\"Conform thyself\\nto Nature! \"with what sincerity, what enthusiasm, what religious fervour, he enounces that precept, to \\nothers, to himself!  Recovering, as he fancies, a certain primeval sense of Deity broadcast on things, a \\nsense in which Pythagoras and other \"inspired\" theorists of early Greece had abounded, in his hands \\nphilosophy becomes a poem, a sacred poem, as it had been with them.  That Bruno himself, in \"the \\nenthusiasm of the idea,\" drew from his axiom of the \"indifference of contraries\" the practical consequence \\nwhich is in very deed latent there, that he was ready to sacrifice to the antinomianism, which is certainly a \\npart of its rigid logic, the austerities, the purity of his own youth, for instance, there is no proof.  The \\nservice, the sacrifice, he is ready to bring to the great light that has dawned for him, occupying his entire \\nconscience with the sense of his responsibilities to it, is the sacrifice of days and nights spent in eager \\nstudy, of plenary, disinterested utterance of the thoughts that arise in him, at any hazard, at the price, say!\\nof martyrdom.  The work of the divine Spirit, as he conceives it, exalts, inebriates him, till the scientific \\napprehension seems to take the place of prayer, oblation, communion.  It would be a mistake, he holds, to\\nattribute to the human soul capacities merely passive or receptive. She, too, possesses initiatory power \\nas truly as the divine soul of the world, to which she responds with the free gift of a light and heat that \\nseem her own.  \\nYet a nature so opulently endowed can hardly have been lacking in purely physical or sensuous ardours.  \\nHis pantheistic belief that the Spirit of God is in all things, was not inconsistent with, nay! might \\nencourage, a keen and restless eye for the dramatic details of life and character however minute, for \\nhumanity in all its visible attractiveness, since there too, in truth, divinity lurks.  From those first fair days of\\nearly Greek speculation, love had occupied a large place in the conception of philosophy; and in after \\ndays Bruno was fond of developing, like Plato, like the Christian Platonists, combining something of the \\npeculiar temper of each, the analogy between the flights of intellectual enthusiasm and those of physical \\nlove, with an animation which shows clearly enough the reality of his experience in the latter.  The Eroici \\nFurori, his book of books, dedicated to Philip Sidney, who would be no stranger to such thoughts, \\npresents a singular blending of verse and prose, after the manner of Dante\\'s Vita Nuova.  The ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 36}),\n Document(page_content='supervening philosophic comment reconsiders those earlier, physically erotic, impulses which had \\nprompted the sonnet in voluble Italian, entirely to the advantage of their abstract, incorporeal, theoretic, \\nequivalents.  Yet if it is after all but a prose comment, it betrays no lack of the natural stuff out of which \\nsuch mystic transferences must be made.  That there is no single name of preference, no Beatrice, or \\nLaura, by no means proves the young man\\'s earlier desires to have been merely Platonic; and if the \\ncolours of love inevitably lose a little of their force and propriety by such deflexion from their earlier \\npurpose, their later intellectual purpose as certainly finds its opportunity thereby, in the matter of borrowed\\nfire and wings. A kind of old scholastic pedantry creeping back over the ardent youth who had thrown it off\\nso defiantly (as if love himself went in now for a University degree), Bruno developes, under the mask of \\namorous verse, all the various stages of abstraction, by which, as the last step of a long ladder, the mind \\nattains actual \"union.\"  For, as with the purely religious mystics, \"union,\" the mystic union of souls with one\\nanother and their Lord, nothing less than union between the contemplator and the contemplated--the \\nreality, or the sense, or at least the name of such union--was always at hand.  Whence that instinctive \\ntendency towards union if not from the Creator of things Himself, who has doubtless prompted it in the \\nphysical universe, as in man?  How familiar the thought that the whole creation, not less than the soul of \\nman, longs for God, \"as the hart for the water- brooks\"!  To unite oneself to the infinite by largeness and \\nlucidity of intellect, to enter, by that admirable faculty, into eternal life- -this was the true vocation of the \\nspouse, of the rightly amorous soul.  A filosofia è necessario amore.  There would be degrees of progress\\ntherein, as of course also of relapse: joys and sorrows, therefore.  And, in interpreting these, the \\nphilosopher, whose intellectual ardours have superseded religion and physical love, is still a lover and a \\nmonk.  All the influences of the convent, the sweet, heady incense, the pleading sounds, the sophisticated\\nlight and air, the grotesque humours of old gothic carvers, the thick stratum of pagan sentiment beneath \\nall this,--Santa Maria sopra Minervam!--are indelible in him.  Tears, sympathies, tender inspirations, \\nattraction, repulsion, zeal, dryness, recollection, desire:--he finds a place for them all: knows them all well \\nin their unaffected simplicity, while he seeks the secret and secondary, or, as he fancies, the primary, \\nform and purport of each.  \\nWhether as a light on actual life, or as a mere barren scholastic subtlety, never before had the pantheistic \\ndoctrine been developed with such completeness, never before connected with so large a sense of \\nnature, so large a promise of the knowledge of it as it really is. The eyes that had not been wanting to \\nvisible humanity turned now with equal liveliness on the natural world, in that region of his birth, where all \\nthe colour and force of nature are at least two- fold.  Nature is not only a thought or meditation in the \\ndivine mind; it is also the perpetual energy of that mind, which, ever identical with itself, puts forth and \\nabsorbs in turn all the successive forms of life, of thought, of language even.  What seemed like striking \\ntransformations of matter were in truth only a chapter, a clause, in the great volume of the transformations\\nof the divine Spirit.  The mystic recognition that all is indeed divine had accompanied a realisation of the \\nlargeness of the field of concrete knowledge, the infinite extent of all there was actually to know. Winged, \\nfortified, by that central philosophic faith, the student proceeds to the detailed reading of nature, led on \\nfrom point to point by manifold lights, which will surely strike on him by the way, from the divine \\nintelligence in it, speaking directly, sympathetically, to a like intelligence in him.  The earth\\'s wonderful \\nanimation, as divined by one who anticipates by a whole generation the Baconian \"philosophy of \\nexperience\": in that, those bold, flighty, pantheistic speculations become tangible matter of fact.  Here was\\nthe needful book for man to read; the full revelation, the story in detail, of that one universal mind, \\nstruggling, emerging, through shadow, substance, manifest spirit, in various orders of being,--the veritable\\nhistory of God.  And nature, together with the true pedigree and evolution of man also, his gradual issue \\nfrom it, was still all to learn.  The delightful tangle of things!--it would be the delightful task of man\\'s \\nthoughts to disentangle that.  Already Bruno had measured the space which Bacon would fill, with room, \\nperhaps, for Darwin also.  That Deity is everywhere, like all such abstract propositions, is a two-edged \\nforce, depending for its practical effect on the mind which admits it on the peculiar perspective of that \\nmind.  To Dutch Spinosa, in the next century, faint, consumptive, with a naturally faint hold on external \\nthings, the theorem that God was in all things whatever, annihilating their differences, suggested a \\nsomewhat chilly withdrawal from the contact of all alike.  But in Bruno, eager and impassioned, an Italian \\nof the Italians, it awoke a constant, inextinguishable appetite for every form of experience,--a fear, as of \\nthe one sin possible, of limiting, for one\\'s self or another, the great stream flowing for thirsty souls, that \\nwide pasture set ready for the hungry heart.  \\nConsidered from the point of view of a minute observation of nature, the Infinite might figure as \"the ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 37}),\n Document(page_content='infinitely little\"; no blade of grass being like another, as there was no limit to the complexities of an atom of\\nearth,--cell, sphere, within sphere.  And the earth itself, hitherto seemingly the privileged centre of a very \\nlimited universe, was, after all, but an atom in an infinite world of starry space, then lately divined by \\ncandid intelligence, which the telescope was one day to present to bodily eyes.  For if Bruno must needs \\nlook forward to the future, to Bacon, for adequate knowledge of the earth, the infinitely little, he could look \\nbackwards also gratefully to another daring mind which had already put that earth into its modest place, \\nand opened the full view of the heavens.  If God is eternal, then, the universe is infinite and worlds \\ninnumerable.  Yes! one might well have divined what reason now demonstrated, indicating those endless \\nspaces which a real sidereal science would gradually occupy.  \\nThat the stars are suns: that the earth is in motion: that the earth is of like stuff with the stars:--now the \\nfamiliar knowledge of children--dawning on Bruno as calm assurance of reason on appeal from the \\nprejudice of the eye, brought to him an inexpressibly exhilarating sense of enlargement in the intellectual, \\nnay! the physical atmosphere.  And his consciousness of unfailing unity and order did not desert him in \\nthat broader survey, which made the utmost one could ever know of the earth seem but a very little \\nchapter in the endless history of God the Spirit, rejoicing so greatly in the admirable spectacle that it never\\nceases to evolve from matter new conditions.  The immoveable earth, as we term it, beneath one\\'s \\nfeet!--Why, one almost felt the movement, the respiration, of God in it.  And yet how greatly even the \\nphysical eye, the sensible imagination (so to term it) was flattered by the theorem.  What joy in that \\nmotion, in the prospect, the music!  \"The music of the spheres!\"--he could listen to it in a perfection such \\nas had never been conceded to Plato, to Pythagoras even.--  \\n     Veni, Creator Spiritus,  \\n     Mentes tuorum visita,  \\n     Imple superna gratia,  \\n     Quae tu creasti pectora.+  \\nYes!  The grand old Christian hymns, perhaps the grandest of them all, seemed to lend themselves in the \\nchorus, to be deepened immeasurably under this new intention.  It is not always, or often, that men\\'s \\nabstract ideas penetrate the temperament, touch the animal spirits, affect conduct.  It was what they did \\nwith Bruno.  The ghastly spectacle of the endless material universe--infinite dust, in truth, starry as it may \\nlook to our terrestrial eyes--that prospect from which the mind of Pascal recoiled so painfully, induced in \\nBruno only the delightful consciousness of an ever-widening kinship and sympathy, since every one of \\nthose infinite worlds must have its sympathetic inhabitants.  Scruples of conscience, if he felt such, might \\nwell be pushed aside for the \"excellency\" of such knowledge as this.  To shut the eyes, whether of the \\nbody or the mind, would be a kind of sullen ingratitude;--the one sin to believe, directly or indirectly, in any\\nabsolutely dead matter anywhere, as being implicitly a denial of the indwelling spirit.--A free spirit, \\ncertainly, as of old!  Through all his pantheistic flights, from horizon to horizon, it was still the thought of \\nliberty that presented itself, to the infinite relish of this \"prodigal son\" of Dominic.  God the Spirit had made\\nall things indifferently, with a largeness, a beneficence, impiously belied by any theory of restrictions, \\ndistinctions, of absolute limitation.  Touch! see! listen! eat freely of all the trees of the garden of Paradise, \\nwith the voice of the Lord God literally everywhere!--here was the final counsel of perfection.  The world \\nwas even larger than youthful appetite, youthful capacity.  Let theologian and every other theorist beware \\nhow he narrowed either.  \"The plurality of worlds!\"--How petty in comparison seemed those sins, the \\npurging of which was men\\'s chief motive in coming to places like this convent, whence Bruno, with vows \\nbroken, or for him obsolete, presently departed.  A sonnet, expressive of the joy with which he returned to \\nso much more than the liberty of ordinary men, does not suggest that he was driven from it. Though he \\nmust have seemed to those who surely had loved so loveable a creature there to be departing, like the \\n\"prodigal\" of the Gospel, into the farthest of possible far countries, there is no proof of harsh treatment on \\ntheir part, or even of an effort to detain him.  \\nIt happens most naturally of course that those who undergo the shock of spiritual or intellectual change \\nsometimes fail to recognise their debt to the deserted cause:--How much of the heroism, or other high \\nquality, of their rejection has really been the product of what they reject?  Bruno, the escaped monk, is still\\na monk; and his philosophy, impious as it might seem to some, a religion; very new indeed, yet a religion. \\nHe came forth well-fitted by conventual influences to play upon men as he had been played upon.  A \\nchallenge, a war-cry, an alarum, everywhere he seemed to be but the instrument of some subtly \\nmaterialised spiritual force, like that of the old Greek prophets, that \"enthusiasm\" he was inclined to set so\\nhigh, or like impulsive Pentecostal fire.  His hunger to know, fed dreamily enough at first within the ', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 38}),\n Document(page_content='convent walls, as he wandered over space and time, an indefatigable reader of books, would be fed \\nphysically now by ear and eye, by large matter-of-fact experience, as he journeys from university to \\nuniversity; less as a teacher than a courtier, a citizen of the world, a knight-errant of intellectual light.  The \\nphilosophic need to try all things had given reasonable justification to the stirring desire for travel common\\nto youth, in which, if in nothing else, that whole age of the later Renaissance was invincibly young.  The \\ntheoretic recognition of that mobile spirit of the world, ever renewing its youth, became the motive of a life \\nas mobile, as ardent, as itself, of a continual journey, the venture and stimulus of which would be the \\noccasion of ever-new discoveries, of renewed conviction.  \\nThe unity, the spiritual unity, of the world:--that must involve the alliance, the congruity, of all things with \\none another, of the teacher\\'s personality with the doctrine he had to deliver, of the spirit of that doctrine \\nwith the fashion of his utterance, great reinforcements of sympathy.  In his own case, certainly, when \\nBruno confronted his audience at Paris, himself, his theme, his language, were alike the fuel of one clear \\nspiritual flame, which soon had hold of his audience also; alien, strangely alien, as that audience might \\nseem from the speaker.  It was intimate discourse, in magnetic touch with every one present, with his \\nspecial point of impressibility; the sort of speech which, consolidated into literary form as a book, would be\\na dialogue according to the true Attic genius, full of those diversions, passing irritations, unlooked-for \\nappeals, in which a solicitous missionary finds his largest range of opportunity, and takes even dull wits \\nunaware.  In Bruno, that abstract theory of the perpetual motion of the world was become a visible person\\ntalking with you.  \\nAnd as the runaway Dominican was still in temper a monk, so he presented himself to his audience in the \\ncomely Dominican habit.  The reproachful eyes were to-day for the most part kindly observant, registering\\nevery detail of that singular company, all the physiognomic effects which come, by the way, on people, \\nand, through them, on things,--the \"shadows of ideas\" in men\\'s faces--his own pleasantly expressive with \\nthem, in turn.  De Umbris Idearum: it was the very title of his discourse.  There was \"heroic gaiety\" there: \\nonly, as usual with gaiety, it made the passage of a peevish cloud seem all the chillier.  Lit up, in the \\nagitation of speaking, by many a harsh or scornful beam, yet always sinking, in moments of repose, to an \\nexpression of high-bred melancholy, the face was one that looked, after all, made for suffering,--already \\nhalf pleading, half defiant, as of a creature you could hurt, but to the last never shake a hair\\'s-breadth \\nfrom its estimate of yourself.  \\nLike nature, like nature in that opulent country of his birth which the \"Nolan,\" as he delighted to call \\nhimself, loved so well that, born wanderer as he was, he must perforce return thither sooner or later at the\\nrisk of life, he gave plenis manibus, but without selection, and was hardly more fastidious in speech than \\nthe \"asinine\" vulgar he so deeply contemned.  His rank, un-weeded eloquence, abounding in play of \\nwords, rabbinic allegories, verses defiant of prosody, in the kind of erudition he professed to despise, with \\nhere and there a shameless image,--the product not of formal method, but of Neapolitan \\nimprovisation--was akin to the heady wine, the sweet, coarse odours, of that fiery, volcanic soil, fertile in \\nsuch irregularities as manifest power.  Helping himself indifferently to all religions for rhetoric illustration, \\nhis preference was still for that of the soil, the old pagan religion, and for the primitive Italian gods, whose \\nnames and legends haunt his speech, as they do the carved and pictorial work of that age of the \\nRenaissance.  To excite, to surprise, to move men\\'s minds, like the volcanic earth as if in travail, and, \\naccording to the Socratic fancy, to bring them to the birth, was after all the proper function of the teacher, \\nhowever unusual it might seem in so ancient a university. \"Fantastic!\"--from first to last, that was the \\ndescriptive epithet; and the very word, carrying us to Shakespeare, reminds one how characteristic of the \\nage such habit was, and that it was pre- eminently due to Italy.  A man of books, he had yet so vivid a \\nhold on people and things, that the traits and tricks of the audience seemed to strike from his memory all \\nthe graphic resources of his old readings.  He seemed to promise some greater matter than was then \\nactually exposed by him; to be himself enjoying the fulness of a great outlook, the vague suggestion of \\nwhich did but sustain the curiosity of the listeners.  And still, in hearing him speak you seemed to see that \\nsubtle spiritual fire to which he testified kindling from word to word.  What Gaston then heard was, in truth,\\nthe first fervid expression of all those contending views out of which his written works would afterwards be\\ncompacted, of course with much loss of heat in the process.  Satyric or hybrid growths, things due to \\nhybris,+ insult, insolence, to what the old satyrs of fable embodied,--the volcanic South is kindly prolific of \\nthese, and Bruno abounded in mockery; though it was by way of protest.  So much of a Platonist, for \\nPlato\\'s genial humour he had nevertheless substituted the harsh laughter of Aristophanes.

In \\ntruth, Aristotle, the supplanter of Plato, was still in possession, pretending, as Bruno conceived, to \\ndetermine heaven and earth by precedent, hiding the proper nature of things from the eyes of men.  \\n\"Habit\"--the last word of his practical philosophy--indolent habit! what would this mean, in the intellectual \\nlife, but just that sort of dead judgments which, because the mind, the eye, were no longer really at work \\nin them, are most opposed to the essential quickness and freedom of the spirit?  \\nThe Shadows of Ideas: De Umbris Idearum: such, in set terms, have been the subject of Bruno\\'s \\ndiscourse, appropriately to the still only half emancipated intellect of his audience:--on approximations to \\ntruth: the divine imaginations, as seen, darkly, more bearably by weaker faculties, in words, in visible \\nfacts, in their shadows merely.  According to the doctrine of \"Indifference,\" indeed, there would be no real \\ndistinction between substance and shadow.  In regard to man\\'s feeble wit, however, varying degrees of \\nknowledge constituted such a distinction. \"Ideas, and Shadows of Ideas\": the phrase recurred often; and, \\nas such mystic phrases will, fixed itself in Gaston\\'s fancy, though not quite according to the mind of the \\nspeaker; accommodated rather to the thoughts which just then preoccupied his own.  As already in his life\\nthere had been the Shadows of Events,--the indirect yet fatal influence there of deeds in which he had no \\npart, so now, for a time, he seemed to fall under the spell, the power, of the Shadows of Ideas, of Bruno\\'s \\nIdeas; in other words, of those indirect suggestions, which, though no necessary part of, yet inevitably \\nfollowed upon, his doctrines. What, for instance, might be the proper practical limitations of that telling \\ntheory of \"the coincidence, the indifference, of opposites\"?  \\nTo that true son of the Renaissance, in the light of his large, antique, pagan ideas, the difference between\\nRome and the Reform would figure, of course, as but an insignificant variation upon some deeper and \\nmore radical antagonism, between two tendencies of men\\'s minds.  But what about an antagonism \\ndeeper still?  Between Christ and the world, say!--Christ and the flesh!--or about that so very ancient \\nantagonism between good and evil.  Was there any place really left for imperfection, moral or otherwise, \\nin a world, wherein the minutest atom, the lightest thought, could not escape from God\\'s presence?  Who \\nshould note the crime, the sin, the mistake, in the operation of that eternal spirit, which was incapable of \\nmis- shapen births?  In proportion as man raised himself to the ampler survey of the divine work around \\nhim, just in that proportion did the very notion of evil disappear.  There were no weeds, no \"tares,\" in the \\nendless field.  The truly illuminated mind, discerning spiritually, might do what it would.  Even under the \\nshadow of monastic walls, that had sometimes been the precept, which larger theories of \"inspiration\" had\\nbequeathed to practice.  \"Of all the trees of the garden thou mayest freely eat!--If ye take up any deadly \\nthing, it shall not hurt you!--And I think that I, too, have the spirit of God.\"  \\nBruno, a citizen of the world, Bruno at Paris, was careful to warn off the vulgar from applying the decisions\\nof philosophy beyond its proper speculative limits.  But a kind of secrecy, an ambiguous atmosphere, \\nencompassed, from the first, alike the speaker and the doctrine; and in that world of fluctuating and \\nambiguous characters, the alerter mind certainly, pondering on this novel \"reign of the spirit\"--what it \\nmight actually be--would hardly fail to find in Bruno\\'s doctrines a method of turning poison into food, to live\\nand thrive thereon; an art, to Paris, in the intellectual and moral condition of that day, hardly less \\nopportune than had it related to physical poisons.  If Bruno himself was cautious not to suggest the ethic \\nor practical equivalent to his theoretic positions, there was that in his very manner of speech, in that rank, \\nun-weeded eloquence of his, which seemed naturally to discourage any effort at selection, any sense of \\nfine difference, of nuances or proportion, in things.  The loose sympathies of his genius were allied to \\nnature, nursing, with equable maternity of soul, good, bad, and indifferent alike, rather than to art, \\ndistinguishing, rejecting, refining. Commission and omission! sins of the former surely had the natural \\npreference.  And how would Paolo and Francesca have read this lesson? How would Henry, and \\nMargaret of the \"Memoirs,\" and other susceptible persons then present, read it, especially if the \\nopposition between practical good and evil traversed diametrically another distinction, the \"opposed \\npoints\" of which, to Gaston for instance, could never by any possibility become \"indifferent,\"--the \\ndistinction, namely, between the precious and the base, aesthetically; between what was right and wrong \\nin the matter of art?  \\n  \\n*** END OF THIS TEXT Gaston de Latour ***', metadata={'source': './test.pdf', 'page': 40})]"
